I also have experience in thermo forming some materials such as kydex. I am a service technician for a company that sells  high end printing solutions and in the near future we will be carrying 3d systems products. I will be attempting to get my dealership to help me participate in this awesome program. But will have to have a product to show them first. Is there a forum in which I can see older threads and designs and get the programming code for the arduino board? Thanks in advance.,,,,,1,1,,

Our team is working on a hand for a seven year old kid who has three under-developed fingers (index middle and ring) on his left hand. One of our goals is to let him bat with both of his hands. This goal is hard because of both the weight of a bat and the motion of swinging for batting.
We wonder if anyone has used an e-nable's hand model to bat baseball. If so are there any videos or photos that we can find online? And which hand device was it?
Thank you! ",,1,,,1,1,,

I've had a bit of a search through old posts and the e-NABLE website but haven't managed to satisfactorily answer this myself so some more experienced input would be good (Excuse the long post but in this circumstance it pays to be thorough). 

I'm curious and a tiny bit concerned around the legal aspects of the e-NABLE project. As a current student of Biomedical Engineering I have been learning a lot about the legal frameworks for Medical Device Regulation in several markets (mostly US EU & AU). From the FDA website it is quite evident that external upper limb prosthetics are classified as a Class I medical device in the US covered under CFR 890.3420 (Source: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=890.3420 & https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpcd/classification.cfm?ID=5060). In Australia the TGA classifies the device as a Class I medical device as well and has some good guidelines on ""Custom Made Medical Devices"" (Source: https://www.tga.gov.au/custom-made-medical-devices). I haven't had a chance to look into the EU (I should be studying for exams right now) but I'm assuming it would be along similar lines too.

Focusing on the US In CFR 890.3420 the FDA states that this type of medical device is ""exempt from adherence to the 'Good Manufacturing Practice' requirements with the exception of 820.180 regarding general requirements concerning records and 820.198 regarding complaint files as long as the device is not labelled or otherwise represented as sterile."" This is good news as compliance with the long and stringent list of GMP requirements would be near impossible for a diverse group of volunteers and manufacturing facilities. However this doesn't mean e-NABLE is clear of the regulatory woods so to speak.

I know the argument has been made that these devices are not being commercially sold and therefore do not fall under medical device regulations but I don't think this argument holds any water a medical device is a medical device regardless of whether it sells for a million dollars or is given away free (would be happily proved wrong if anyone has a reliable source though).

My main questions to the group would be:
1. Has anyone in the e-NABLE community looked deeply into the regulatory requirements surrounding the use of these kinda devices and started formulating a basic regulatory strategy/plan? If not I think this could be a useful addition to the ""Safety Guidelines"" section on the website.  
2. Jon Schull uploaded a draft from the FDA regarding 3D printed medical devices. Has there been any follow-up or developments on this?
3. Has anyone opened a dialogue with any regulatory affairs agencies such as the FDA around the use of devices such as this?

Some key features I think that could definitely benefit the e-NABLE project should regulatory affair (and god forbid the FDA) get involved:
a. Device production records keeping. Minimum records would include basic patient details (would need to look further into privacy issues) key production information (materials and methods used any part failures or revisions any disinfection undertaken [Note avoid the use of the word sterilisation]). This could possibly take the form of a standard document that is filled out by the volunteer manufacturer's post-production and uploaded to a database for each device produced.
b. Unique device identifiers to enable faulty product tracking. This could take the form of a unique code for each device produced generated by a central database (linked with the above production records the patient and the individual that produced the device)
c. A Corrective and Preventative Action (CAPA) Plan. This is a fundamental aspect of any Quality Management System. A CAPA is one of the first places the FDA like to look and the absence of a CAPA system is a huge red flag. A key component of this would be feedback and complaints handling from patients who have received the device. Jen Mankoff sent a notification the other day about starting up a feedback Pool which would address this
d. A very clear ""intentions of use"" statement that is available on the website and is provided to the patient with each device. All medical devices normally have to have one of these in short it states the conditions that the device can be used to treat and how the device is to be installed and used normally. This may seem obvious but is incredibly important so that a patient doesn't try to stick the device in their eye and then sue you for causing their blindness. I'm happy to say that the basics for this are well covered on the  ""Safety Guidelines"" section on the website already.
e. Theres lot's more but the above will do for talking points for now...

I'm not suggesting that we should be looking to submit a regulatory application to any of the major regulatory bodies this would become time-consuming and expensive very quickly but it may not hurt to have some of these details well documented. In fact I think it could hurt a lot to completely disregard some of these issues and I'd hate to see the e-NABLE community face sanctions or get shut down as a result.

Again sorry for the long winded post if you've gotten to here then thank you for sticking with me. I just thought I'd draw attention to regulatory issues for those in the community that may be unaware and would also like to hear the thoughts of others on how we can address this challenge especially any that have experience in the medical devices industry.

I've got a lot of good and current documentation on regulatory requirements from my University Course that I'd be willing to share with anyone who's interested and I'd be willing to help out the community to help develop and implement some of the items mentioned above. I know regulatory affairs is a subject most people would consider as palatable as drinking acid but its also sadly a necessary evil and ignorance of the issues isn't a valid defence. 
CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21
(a) Identification. An external limb prosthetic component is a device intended for medical purposes that when put together with other appropriate components constitutes a total prosthesis. Examples of external limb prosthetic components include the following: Ankle foot hip knee and socket ...

What Does Google+ Mean To You?

This is one of my famous ""very long reads"" so take your time with it and pace yourself!

A few years back I had a lofty goal in mind to write a book about mastering Google+ and providing insights into how I was able to navigate the waters of this UI. I live on a rural farm in NW Ohio and somehow I've gathered 55000 followers and 32 million views of my posts so it feels like I'm doing a few things right. I had about 45 pages written but life being unemployed for a lengthy time then finally finding great new work intervened and this book is now collecting dust in Drive.

But I did reach out to many incredible people on G+ and I asked them one simple question: What does Google+ mean to you?

I hope they won't mind if I share their stories here. I don't want their words to disappear to time and until I finish this book (and I will!) I thought my circles might enjoy seeing their thoughts. I'd love to hear from them all now and see if anything's changed or gotten better. This is a great journey we're all on...

If you'd like to add your own extended words on this topic comment here of PM me and I'll be sure you're added. Also if any of these authors no longer would like to have their words publicly posted in the stream I'll respect your wishes and remove your words. But each response was lovely and I hope my readers enjoy seeing where all of our collective heads were when I asked the question...

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Paul Roustan - Providence Rhode Island USA +Paul Roustan 

Google+ has been by far the best means for me to showcase my work. More importantly it is a platform allowing me to develop relationships with people of all sorts be it friendships colleagues and/or valuable connections for my artwork. I don't think there is any better method to connect to an important person the right person bypassing their agency/secretary/bodyguard or whoever would normally deny contact. This is a TREMENDOUS benefit to artists/musicians/directors/etc. Google+ cuts out the middle man allowing many people to exist that may never have been found.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Stephanie Van Pelt - Florida USA +Stephanie Van Pelt 

Sometimes technology has a way of touching us in the most unexpected ways.

I joined Google Plus during its infancy within the first month during the throttled-invite-only phase. I must confess I was courted more by the exclusivity of it all than because I was so very anxious to join another social network. All I knew was that you had to be invited and that it was only 1 week old.

It took me only a week or so to drum up the courage to join a Hangout a feature that allows you to video chat with up to 9 other people from pretty much anywhere. It was scary my palms were sweaty and they were complete strangers. In fact everyone I interacted with on Google Plus was a stranger. And yet there we were saying hello responding to posts and exchanging ideas down threads of conversation.

I really had no idea what was in store for me. None. If you told me then where I’d be now I would have said you’re insane.

Once I recovered from the initial nervousness I realized everyone else was in the same predicament. Some hid it better than others or were just inherently more comfortable with the medium; however Google Plus was too new for anyone to be established at Hangouts. As the comfort level grew so did my enjoyment and love of Hangouts.

As a single mom I don’t get out much these days. The boys are in bed early but I am up for hours still a night owl and social by my very nature. Hangouts give me the opportunity to connect with people from all over the world to sit up late at night and converse argue debate listen to music explore the internet and ultimately forge some incredible new connections and relationships.

Over the past 6 months I’ve been able to broaden my horizons in fantastic ways. I was introduced to dubstep (yes I know!) through a music Hangout. I’ve gotten to know more about the remarkable differences and intriguing traditions of other cultures through direct chat with strangers I may never see or meet. I’ve randomly helped a few strangers through small donations. I’ve seen exotic locations through mobile Hangouts and had discussions on everything from food to health care to love won (and lost) .

There have been some incredible personal stories shared with me. Some publicly in comments on threads and some far more privately. I’m always touched when virtual strangers open up and tell me more about what makes them them.

After posing a question what book really seized your imagination and got you to start reading I was astounded at some of the deep answers shared with me. Behind the curtain of a monitor people shared parts of themselves few people share face to face. I read about one person using books to fulfill the role models they never received from their own parents; another shared his personal work experience with one of my favorite authors.

Similar stories moving and emotional came after a post about dating single parents. I cherish each time people shared themselves with me. Everything from a mother’s death to the loss of a twin to surviving childhood cancer to orphaned adults alone for the holidays…job loss promotions! gift exchanges sharing of that one little link you know will matter to someone exposure to new music – so much to explore but all of it in a very personal matter.

What this has really boiled down to for me is that all those random strange “internet people” have become so much more. Connecting through common interests rather than common locations I feel like I’ve had this amazing opportunity to explore the people that make up the internet.

So what happened to me? I wound  up on a cruise with some of those “internet people” and had the absolute time of my life. I challenge you  who’s out there waiting for you to get to know them? Who haven’t you met yet? What haven’t you learned about yet?

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Liz Quilty - Cambridge New Zealand +Liz Quilty 

Google+ has meant a lot to me it’s enabled me to connect to like minded people who are not always the majority. Being a female in technology means i work and live in a very male orientated world though i don’t think that this is necessarily a bad thing. 

However i would have liked to meet more females in the industry and be able to help us promote each other to get more voice and encourage other females who are looking to get into things. Being able to interact with those people and helping organize things like +STEM Women on G+ has been amazingly awesome.

Google is actively helping us with our task and this in itself is what is setting it apart from other social media platforms. Google have done this with several other groups and people and especially minority groups with a good cause have found a voice. 

For this reason Google+ has changed my life and the life of a lot of others in a similar way :) For me Google+ is support supporting those who want to help themselves go places and do things :) Its also friendship and great conversation i have got a LOT from a lot of great people!

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Michael Vaughan - Mackay Queensland Australia +Michael Vaughan 

My first motivation for using Google+ was that it was not Facebook.  At the time Google+ was announced I was still futilely trying to convince people to use Orkut. Google+ for me hasn't become the Facebook-killer I'd hoped because so few people I know in meatspace use it however I've met so many cool people here.  I think this must be what it felt like for those first internet users with their wholly new online communities BBSs and such.

Possibly the thing I like most about Google+ though aside from the features is just how accessible the semi-famous can be.  Bloggers artists authors actors; at some point I've actually exchanged words with people I've looked up to for so long and that is what keeps me using it.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Daf Griffiths - Ponciau Wales United Kingdom +Daf Griffiths 

G+ has been a big boost for me if you met me face to face you would instantly turn to one of my friends and say the same thing everybody else does: ""this guy is hard work to talk to""!

I used to be the type of person who lived for the attention on stage. I always took great pleasure from compliments about my performance in musicals as it meant I'd done my work right and by doing it right I mean I wasn't me for 3 hours. My greatest pleasure in life was rehearsing for 4 months of the year to not be me for 3 hours a night over the space of a week and that week was the highlight of my year

NOW every day is a highlight as G+ has allowed me to be myself without having to come face to face with people in difficult environments and it's incredibly liberating! I aim to join in with hangouts soon and that will be a major turning point for me but with the friends that I've made on here I'm not worried about the outcome as I already trust those people implicitly.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of jay dawge - Maine USA +jay dawge 

OK here goes Google plus came along at a time when things were quite mixed up. I was having a really hard time finding work so I sold my home and moved south for a job offer that paid better. The move brought me closer to my daughters home +kool cat so the move was a no brainer. I did not know anybody down here and I met my roommate the same day I moved down. I worked a lot and had no friends here so google plus was a good escape. I have met so many cool people doing so many cool things in so many cool places that I don't know how I would get by w/o them. G+ also gives me a way to share cool music pictures stories and art with my daughter ""and many others around the world for that matter"". 

Thank you to all that I have met for the laughter joy and sorrow you have shared. For those that are home sick for Maine +Sean Cowen  and a few others I have met I think about you when I snap and post photos trying to capture subjects that are typical of Maine life. I could ramble on for hours but I will spare you the irony LOL good luck w/ your book I know it will be good w/ your talent and G+ users for the subject matter you will do well.

Google Plus for me has been a venue that has shown infinite possibilities   So many minds and so many talents have contributed to expanding the horizon of human inspiration for all of us; it's been a fantastic 14 months journey so far and the future appears only as bright as ever. Using this brilliant and fantastic technology through blog posts comments debates images sound and hangouts incredible people virtual pioneers of a new world have offered and shared the best of themselves their knowledge and experience to enhance our human experience.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Stefan Svartling - Nycöping Sweden +Stefan Svartling 

Google+ has the most interaction I've ever seen so when it came I'll immediately stopped blogging on my old normal blogs and started to use Google+ as my main blog. My only blog. Why not blog where the interaction is was my thoughts and I have never looked back.

So to me Google+ means everything. I love Google+ and all the interaction. It's my home online.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of David Bowden - Santa Monica California USA +David Bowden 

The answer to your question is simple really (for me anyway). I came to Google+ to share photography. Unlike many digital photographers I tend to shoot as I did in film. Meaning I take a moment to compose measure and shoot. I don’t use the back of the camera much I tend to focus on what I see in the viewfinder and my overall composition.

What this means is that I don/t take as many pictures as others do. I also have a standard that I don't share ""crap."" If I am going to put my name on it then it needs to be good.

What does this have to do with my best moment on G+. Well this set of circumstances is what led to my writing. You see I ran out of photos to share. Being focused on growing my following I decided to share a story as opposed to a photo.

It led to the post ""A Good Day"" which is to date one of my most popular shares and most read and commented posts.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/112022983294967948367/posts/aXWLMoXhwLr

It was on this Wednesday that people began following me in larger numbers commenting and engaging more and the stories followed. Week after week. Sharing this story and reading the comments and seeing the shares associated with it are by far my best experience on G+ and is what keeps me coming back.

I have some very loyal followers great friends and enjoy the community. Good luck with your book and thanks so much for thinking of me.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Glenn Rogers - Bedford Texas USA +Glenn Rogers 

What Google Means to Me and More Importantly Why the Hell Should You Care? +Sean Cowen here ya go!

Oh sure I could tell you about how I happened upon Google Plus through Facebook and Twitter thereby making the obligatory comparisons to both social networks eventually giving Google Plus the nickname ""TwitBook"".  Or I could tell you that I was instantly impressed with the social network for a number of reasons - 1) no stalkers 2) no Zynga invites and most importantly 3) did I mention ""no stalkers""?

I could tell you all that but if you're reading this you've probably realized that I just told you.  So there ya go.

Google Plus short of the invention of sliced bread and Velcro is a true miracle and has become a daily addiction of mine.  A place where I can share my musings with people who will either appreciate them or in some cases report me to Google.  (I'm guessing my recipe for ""sliced Velcro bread"" didn't trend like I hoped)

I have made a number of valuable friends on Google Plus most with the same twisted sense of humor.  Outside of most national sanitariums people like that are a true rarity so yay!

Google Plus gives me a place to be who I am with people who appreciate who I am and in turn I appreciate them for being who they are.  Except for that one guy - he's just wacko.

I just happened to jump into the social network world when the water was still cold and since I joined Google Plus my nipples have never been happier.

So here's to you Google Plus!  From movie riffing hangouts to shameless self-promotion I can think of no better social network.  Facebook and Twitter may have a lot of pluses (ha! see what I did there?) but Google Plus will always be the reason I love social networks.

Oh and stalking?  Still the reason I hate them.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Joel Poirier - Ottawa Ontario Canada +Joel Poirier 

I joined Google+ out of curiosity in the early weeks of its launch and found a strong comics and art community already thriving. For a while I went relatively unnoticed: I'm not an exceptionally sociable person in my real life I don't find it easy to meet new people but through sharing my artwork I found people who were just like me and that made it easier to come out of my shell. 

I persisted in sharing my art and my interests through my comics my drawings of album covers from my vinyl record collection and eventually creating quite spontaneously the Name That 80s Movie game which has become my greatest social media success. Here I am now just over a year later and I'm in hundreds of thousands of circles with my work be seen all over the world thousands more adding me every day all because I share about the things that make me happy. Success is waiting here for anyone! ""

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Martin Watson - Spanish Town Jamaica +Martin Watson 

I don't have much to say though. Not much other than that G+ is the first social network I actually wanted to join. On all the others that I've ever existed I was in a sense dragged onto them kicking and screaming. I first found out about G+ on the day the invite only public field beta had just started. After much begging and pleading to any and everyone that I knew was on here I managed to get in just before midnight on July 3 in the first week.

Since then everything for me changed. The biggest change for me is that I've suddenly become more social. This is very strange for me because I'm an extremely antisocial person. To an extent I still am in real life. On here however I'm almost a different person. I can't explain it. I have absolutely no idea how that happened.

I have also met some of the most amazing people ever large small and somewhere in between. In a sense how big or small you are didn't matter here because it's almost a level playing field for everyone. I still get super nervous and surprised whenever someone like +Mike Elgan mentions me in a post of his that I commented on.

Speaking of surprise and extreme nervousness something of the sort happened earlier this year that almost made my heart stop. It was while we were all in an uproar about CISPA with SOPA/PIPA and ACTA all still fresh in our minds. I had posted the contents of a mass email from someone at Demand Progress. It was a very passionate and moving message. Mere minutes after posting it I was contacted by an extremely big name in the tech media space. (I won't mention her name here but if you really want to know I'll tell you privately. I'm still in shock from all this even though it was months ago.) She asked me to write a commentary on CISPA. A commentary? Me? I'm supposed to write something about CISPA?! Me? Seriously? What the hell do I know? I don't even live in the US! I was in so much shock that I didn't even know to respond! I was surprised she contacted me in the first place!

After calming down I eventually wrote something. I had a friend that was a writer and a friend that wasn't review it. They both liked it so I sent it to her. I heard nothing at all from her since and I hadn't seen it posted or mentioned anywhere at all. Not on her blog her publication that she was building with other tech media giants not on Twitter or G+. After a week of not seeing anything I just assumed she either didn't need it anymore it slipped through the cracks or that it wasn't good enough. She is an extremely busy woman so I understand if she didn't have much time to waste on lowly me.

It was all still an amazing and nerve racking experience though. It was my first time dealing with someone as high profile prominent and successful and her. No wonder I was so scared. If it happened again I would be better prepared to handle it but I would still be scared out of my skin!

In addition to all that I have somewhat found a sort of extended family on G+. I have a second mother on here a few sisters I can actually get along with (only my own sister in real life) and other extremely amazing people that would find very difficult to now live without. Funny thing though through all this I've only ever been in a handful of hangouts. It's the only feature of G+ aside from Games that rarely ever use. The few I've been in were all really great though. :)

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Pam Adger - Riverside California USA +Pam Adger 

My first public post was July 19th 2011. I came home from work and was talking to my daughter Sydney about this new social network by Google called Google Plus. I was lamenting that the thing was invite only and I was dying to get an invite. She then proceeded to tell me she had a “membership to the Google Plus club.” She said…..Mom I know all about G+. My friend Kim invited me two weeks ago.  So with membership comes invites so I got an invite from my 18 year old daughter who to this day has less than 100 followers. I immediately posted the following 

Trying out some recommended follows. So far I am underwhelmed. Self promotion and immaturity. I wish I had a better list of recommendations.

I think it was 3 or 4 weeks before the suggested Users List (SUL) was released. It kinda needs a little work still.  In the beginning I was all about politics. That lasted about a month. I rarely post political now. I have found a great group of people. G+ is my second social network. Facebook was first and I still have my settings pretty locked down though I do post public and people could subscribe to me but they don’t. 35 or 40 IRL people (except Matt Gibson and Tim Jones) are my “friends.” Most are my family and coworkers and I can go weeks without logging on. G+ was something I took to right away. Almost instant chat with people from around the world? Holy Crap how awesome is that?????

One year later I still spend between 4 and 6 hours per day every day including weekends and holidays on G+. It is really more of my life than I would like. 

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Dolidh Young (Eileen)  - Denny Scotland United Kingdom +Dolidh Young 

I started off my G+ life in beta... A time that was very difficult for me as I'd lost my father to cancer the year before and I was still grieving pretty badly. Focusing on putting positive energy into something gave me a push to get social again and not just spending my time moping about the house.

And in turn by being more interested in doing things I started to get out the house a bit more travelling around Scotland doing things I want to do and seeing people I love to hang around with... All pretty much documented on my G+ profile. I use G+ like a blog and a vlog.

G+ has really encouraged me to be expressive creative and a little bit wacky with the new people I've met through posts and hangouts. It's a place I feel I can be myself ^_^ Happy and accepted.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Diniz Chico - Lisbon Portugal +Diniz Chico 

Well after a traumatic experience with Facebook had decided to say ""no more Social Sites."" Completely unmotivated spent almost 6 months without dedicating myself to my woods that i always treated as an hobby and a way to relax my mind. But last December one of my sons said to me: Why not Google +?? Immediately i reply nooo. He argued that it was a different system but my Noo prevailed. But i kept that in mind!! Huummm? Google +? Didn't never heard about it and decided to see. 

So i opened my account just for fun and had a circle about Photography just to see what happened. I upload a few pics of my works and that's it. For 2 or 3 weeks after i even remember i had a new account. When i opened it one day i noticed that some people had shown interest in what i was doing. Well I felt very cherished by the interest and the comments i received daily and since then i never stopped. And now i found myself like a ""Phoenix"" reborn from the ashes always with new projects in my mind to make !! So a BIG thank you to all the Google Art Community..:)

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Daniel Koeker - Riverside California USA +Daniel Koeker 

I joined Google+ when it was in beta mostly because a) it was a Google product and b) because I was in beta and others weren't so neener neener. I wasn't sure what I expected when I came here and goodness knows G+ has changed enough over the short time I've been here. It's quite unlike anything I've experienced from a social network before and that sounds like an advertisement but I've really genuinely enjoyed myself here.

I've met a number of people who were complete strangers that I now talk to on a regular basis. I met people who are now voices of the G+ community. I've hungout with total strangers talked about various topics watched shows got exposed to Doctor Who and for some reason there are nearly five thousand people who have me in their circles. That is so weird to me.

What I've found here is a tight-knit community of intelligent people from all over the place. I've done more than I could have imagined here so far and unlike other social networks that have felt like a chore this is something I actually look forward to. As cool as G+ may be in design it's the people that make it up and some of the best people I know are all here; and the best part is that I wouldn't have known them at all if not for G+. I'd say that's pretty nifty.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Jamie Crouthamel - Charleston South Carolina USA +Jamie Crouthamel 

What Google+ has done for me is to present an amazing and fascinating group of people who have accepted me for exactly who I am. The ideas thoughts photos and work I post here have sparked incredible conversations and connected me to a network of people that encourage me and hold me accountable for being my most authentic self. 

Who knew people I have never met in person can help me to become the best version of myself? Google+ took the social network and elevated it to a network of intelligent passionate individuals who have created the perfect environment for ideas and community to blossom.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Paul Stickland - Dorset United Kingdom +Paul Stickland 

I joined G+ when my working life spirits were at a low ebb. I was drawing towards the end of a four year legal dispute that had seen all my best selling children's books out of print along with a subsequent cessation of royalties. I had been exploring the possibilities of selling my artwork via the world of Print on Demand during this time and guessed that G+ would be a great form of promotion for this.

In days I realised that it would be so much more!

I was talking to scientists 3D printers photographers fellow illustrators authors artists programmers geeks and stars WOW!

Artists illustrators authors can lead quite isolated lives and this huge rush of stimulation has been incredibly energising.

With the amazing benefit of the crowd-editing we enjoy here you have all encouraged me to create so much new work this last year work that I truly feel is closer to my true self than that coaxed out of me by 'professional' editors whose decisions are quite reasonably driven by commercial imperatives.

However this intelligent and informed crowd-editing has resulted in a huge body of work which in turn has led to a great deal of interest from the big publishing houses. What can I say?

Not just for this but for the friendship and humour shared with new friends around the planet Thank You!  

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Brooke Johnson - Rogers Arkansas USA +Brooke Johnson 

Google+ first drew me with its Facebook-and-Twitter-but-better appeal. I was one of the first plussers jumping in while it was still in beta and it was interesting feeling my way around the new digital space slowly finding interesting people to toss in my circles. After my first post last July I’ve circled 900 people and I’m flattered to say that over 1700 people have circled me—a number which seems to grow every day. Sometimes I’m not sure why people circle me. I’m just a goofy girl who posts about writing and other things—Doctor Who steampunk science publishing insights various nerd-doms music and movies I love and random things I find interesting or pretty or funny. I guess people like that or they wouldn’t keep circling me. :)
 
I have never had so much fun on a social network as I do on Google+ and when I go there I can easily spend over an hour just talking to people. Actually talking. Conversations. That’s what I love about it. Everything I say means something. I’m talking to friends and having important discussions about science and fiction and what ifs and of course Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston who are very important topics. When I post something new I feel like people are listening and I feel like these people separated by a few states or countries or sometimes oceans that we’re all a big family that we would do next to anything for each other. I consider a lot of people on Google+ as friends and if I’m ever in close proximity to some of them I will definitely let them know so we can meet up and have real life hijinks.
 
Now I don’t interact will all 900 of the people in my circles or the 1700 people who have circled me but there are a good 100 or more people that no matter what they post I’m going to read it. I’m going to comment or +1 or share it because they’re just that fascinating and fun.
 
As a writer I’ve found Google+ to be a great place to talk about writing with other writers whether they be novelists or screenwriters or poets at all levels of experience. It’s a great place to mine information test waters for an idea share stories and updates about my writing experiences talk about books and debate about this publishing method or that one. It’s a community. And on the flipside I feel like I’ve really connected with readers (who are sometimes writers too). I can talk about my book to people who actually care who want to know how my next book is going so they know when they’ll get to read it. I have fans on Google+ people who will support my writing in any way that they can and that’s fantastic. My experience as a writer on Google+ has shifted my focus from sales numbers and ratings and reviews to readers to people who love books as much as I do who love my books (or will once I have more published). I feel like these people will stick with me and support me as long as I’m putting books out and they make me feel like my writing and my books are worth it. They make me feel like I’m worth it.

I love that Sean has me in his Cool People that Matter circle (I hope that’s what it’s really called. It should be if it isn’t already). I love that I stand out in a sea of other writers artists curators and generally awesome people. I love that I matter to someone I’ve never met that I’m interesting enough to be singled out especially when we’re constantly bombarded from all sides with this picture and that video and ooh look! a funny gif and an interesting article and so on. I feel like I’ve actually made connections with people I never would have met had I not tried this new social front and I don’t think I ever would have really showcased myself—who I am what I like—as I well as I have on Google+. And really I’m more myself there than anywhere else.
 
Google+ is my digital home where I can talk and discuss and rant and promote and share without constraints without judgment without hesitation and I love it.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Laurie M +Laurie M  

When I first came to G+ in was still very new but even so I was in complete awe and wonder over all that I found here. It was different from all the other places that I had been and tried and never really connected with as well as different from the places that I had connected with. I'm very active other places but my activities there are more targeted. Here the things I find speak to my heart my mind my soul and my spirit like nowhere else.

This place speaks the artistic side of me. I've found beautiful stories music videos and images from true artists in not just paint but in photography stories poetry music mixed media technology and so many other ways that I'd never dreamed of before it simply astounds me daily. 

I'm inspired by the true heart that I find in the people and their stories and experiences. The open their hearts and allow me in and in doing so they simply speak to my heart and my mind and move me in so many unexpected ways I'm once again in awe and wonder.

I've enjoyed the interest love and support of such beautiful and interesting people from all over my own nation and even further afield throughout the world. I've even discovered some true friends in people that I would never otherwise have had an opportunity to have talked to let alone developed a relationship with. My life is all the richer for having these people and these experiences in it and even if I never were to speak to them again they have changed me forever and hold a special place in my heart that is all their own. 

So in answer to your inquiry of what are my favorite things the beauty of the people and all the wonders I see daily would have to be my favorite things and what has it meant to me it's meant I've found people that speak to my heart and have enriched by life in their own unique and individual ways and I believe that they've changed me for the better.

Google Plus Hangouts are a magic carpet that can take you around the block or around the world in a matter of minutes.  Hangouts are a free broadcast tower in the middle of a powerful crowdsourcing tool where businesses have the ability not only to find customers but connect with them face to face.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Denise Morgan Kalicki - Manahawkin New Jersey USA +Denise Morgan Kalicki 

I can in on invite last July and knew no one!  But I could tell right away I had found my community!  Oh the things I saw and read the wonders of the beautiful photography being shared the wisdoms and openness of sharing/trading/engaging ideas.  By the end of Oct. sparked by an idea raised in a post I created the G+LeapYear Day Project- A day in the life of G+. 

The project asked that everyone on our +1 day of the year (Feb. 29th) submit a photo that showed some part of their life.  That was a wild wooly and crazy day! 

I met wonderful people here such as you Sean the man who shared delightful movie shorts that made me laugh or haz a sad.  People play DJ sharing playlists and videos.  We have hangouts that are magic! We have covert cupids secret santas and many heartwarming fund raisers. We have joined together to stop child abusers +Plussers Against Child Exploitation to help keep those idiots off G+ and continue to keep this a safe community.  

We all now have good new friends teachers and communities build over the net that joins us.  We can HiRL hangout watch stars being born be interviewed for a news show in Missouri get zombized and best of all all the food porn!  Oh the places we will go!  Even if we are bedridden because others can take us along via hangouts. I love G+ because of the wonderful people here.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Bearman Cartoons - Cincinnati Ohio USA +Bearman Cartoons 

When I first got an invite to join Google Plus I ignored it. I was already on twitter (@bearmancartoons) and on Facebook both as a profile (https://www.facebook.com/bearmancartoons) and a page (https://
www.facebook.com/Beartoons). Why did I need yet another social media outlet. After the fifth email I said what the heck and signed up.

Within the first few days I noticed something different that the other two lacked. Facebook is almost like a club where you have to know someone to get in. We have to know each other to “friend” one another and converse. For someone who draws cartoons for fun that seemed great for my real life friends but horrible for creating new online ones.

With twitter there was another issue. It gave me the ability to follow anyone and there was no obligation or expectation that they would follow me back. I could see what they had to say and even respond. Problem was it is a pain trying to follow a conversation on twitter especially if you aren’t there in the beginning.

That is the difference I saw in Google Plus. I had the ability to follow whomever I wanted and we could engage in a conversation that was easy to follow as it was all in one place. The best of Facebook combined with the best of Twitter. In fact I posted this cartoon to show how I saw the difference between Google Plus and some other social media outlets. http://beartoons.com/2011/08/28/why-google-plus-is-better-than/


So I started circling people. About 200 based on my interests of cartoons learning and Cincinnati. Some followed me back and some didn’t. Many I knew from other social media already. Where I think most people get frustrated with Google Plus is the expectation that everyone you circle will automatically circle you back. Not true. The next step is to actually ENGAGE with the people you circle. That gives them a better idea of who you are and gives them more of a reason to want to circle you back.

Three months in and this was the result: http://beartoons.com/2011/11/27/social-media-love/

And that was before circle shares.

I thought that all this would lead to more people visiting my site. Guess what? It didn’t. But it didn’t matter. I realized that I now had two equally engaging outlets for my work. In addition I could post other thoughts and finds that don’t work well with my blog but are perfect for Google Plus.

One of those things was drawing caricatures. Sure I have done caricatures of politicians and celebrities in the past but avoided real people for some reason with a few giveaways on my blog. Inspired by Googlers like +byron rempel and +Cliff Roth I started doing caricatures of other Google Plus members and started calling them “Muggings”. Anyone circling me could get on the list but those who commissioned me would move to the front of the line. And because I am lucky enough to have a full time job this was bonus money. 

So instead of having people pay me I could support one of my favorite charities Crayons to Computers (http://www.crayons2computers.org/). This organization makes sure students and teachers in the Cincinnati area have the school supplies they need to be successful. So instead of paying me directly I would have the person donate money directly to C2C in honor of Bearman Cartoons. So not only did they get their caricature but also get the tax write off!!! So I can play around on Google Plus draw some pictures and raise money for charity. How cool is that?!!

So then I wanted to see the power of Google Plus. Using my own money I promised to donate $1 to a DC comic led fight to combat hunger in Africa for every share of a video describing the program. https:/
/plus.google.com/103857459148999991693/posts/WUpMKa2eiQf

Several days later I announced the total of 387 shares of the video which spread the message to more people than I ever would on my blog. https://plus.google.com/103857459148999991693/posts/
gNaH8VSSuEc

Which led me to May 2012. For four years on my website I have done a charity challenge where I will donate more and more money for my readers to take on certain challenges. Challenges included paying for every new twitter/facebook follower guest cartoons among other things. (http://beartoons.com/
2012/04/29/bearman-cartoons-charity-challenge-2012/) In the first three years I put a limit on what I would spend and never hit it. This year with the help of Googlers I hit the goal within 3 weeks. In addition for the first time I promised to match donations to Crayons to Computers and several Googlers stepped up including Ann Marie Dwyer  Liz Krane and Shani Hiraoka.

The support I have gotten from both my work and my fundraising efforts has been nothing short of amazing. What I think is sad is that I have found myself at times checking into Google Plus before I even check my own blog. Well maybe not that sad.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Andrew Coffman (Firkked) - Oakley California USA +Andrew Coffman 

I heard about Google Plus just as the Beta was coming to a close and I pestered a Facebook friend for an invite (who is no longer active here).

Once here I found a great community that wasn't out to maximize friends for digital trinkets in online games or ranting about divisive issues with no hope of rational discourse instead I found a community of diverse interests and a sincere desire to engage.

I had heard of engagement in social media but never understood the context before my time on G+. I had control of both my message and who saw it later I had control of how I saw others presenting their own messages.

Since I have been here I have been a part of helping others in real life through donations wish lists social activism teaching learning  debates and live discussions in the hangout feature.

I have been able to share with others the audio-visual peeks into my little corner of the world and others have inspired me to share parts of my life I would have never shared in other outlets.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Matthew Rappaport  - Bayside New York City New York USA +matthew rappaport 

The Google+ Experience has and continues to be all about The People or YOU+ (as I like to post it). There are many social experiences online through many websites that have offered very cool  moments but G+ is the first one where people have gone all out in meeting others & interacting with complete strangers. It didn't take long to find people on the stream and through Hangouts to make the entire PLUSperience become more 4D than any that has come before.

There are no limits on how you can use PLUS and be creative dive deep in head first showing the world not just your passions & life but YOU+  your full personality. It's pretty amazing to show the world YOU+ through what you enjoy and easy to pick up on others by what they post how they are in hangouts and eventually getting to +HIRL  (Hangout in Real Life) with them to make it a FULL Complete CIRCLE!

I don't just say I have online friends or people I talk to online but I really do have brand new friends as well as people that I've now known over a year that are some of my best friends. There are so many on here with so much to share from art & music to comedy & culinary skills to humanitarian efforts and a whole lot that is nothing short of  #awesomesauce !

Each day I'm excited to see what my friends are posting as it leads to discovering new things new people and what's going on in the world! Nowhere else has people involving people in such a selfless way to really engage and truly mean something more. 

As a new PLUS day came around I found myself going for it and posting what I wanted to when I wanted to. People laughed at me for using hashtags mocked me for not understanding my humor or style and even thought I posted way too much but they were in a minority. It's actually refreshing to have diverse opinions and people not being afraid to express themselves here which is a big part of what makes it great. 

After the beta summer of Google+ and hanging out many hours to the point of seeing the sunrise more than I ever did before before sleeping I decided to create a Hangout Chat/Interview show called Hangout Conversations w/Matt Rappaport to showcase people I've met on G+ and not just what they do but who they are and to show the world how awesome the entire Hangout / PLUSperience actually is. 

This lead to many G+ Pages and organizing the 1st H.I.R.L. in NYC back in Feb 2012 and just having a second amazing time in August with  #nychirl2 . People from Google+ are part of my daily online AND offline life & it has made my world become so much more incredible & Plustastic than ever before! I even had the pleasure of meeting photowalking  breaking bread & rocking out with the author who is a lot of fun and truly cares with his true dedication here that you can see in his every post and of course +FRIDAY NIGHT SESSIONS  FTW! 

I look forward to what's to come and would suggest that you start by posting what you love resharing stuff that amuses you searching for keywords that do it for you to find even more people & content to add to your PLUSworld. And.. Definitely HANGOUT! Once you do you'll be hooked looped & circled!

I have redesigned the Kwawu arm to be more natural looking and more functional. The terminal device has a much higher grip strength and functionality. Very good at picking up small things with index finger and thumb and big things with whole hand.

I will release three versions:
1) Just the terminal device with a 1/2"" (a.k.a 12mm) bolt connection. The idea is to be like +Skip Meetze gripper palm. It can be used on a traditional prosthetic arm already fit to the recipient. 

2) A socket version. Similar to the Lionel Arm I did with Jeff Ernestone a year ago. For those people with very short residuals. 

3) A thermoform version similar to the current Kwawu arm.

We are working on scaling and sizing our second print but it os our first wrist powered design. We have two questions for the community. First would the Raptor Reloaded be the best option or should we consider other models as well? The recipient lives in a different city than us so we have not seen her but the mother says that she has decent mobility of the wrist. The second question is about scaling. We have been looking at the Multi-Hand Sizing Guide the width has a positive difference of 2mm but the length of hand has a positive difference of 5mm. How do we scale with those differences? Take the average of size? Or is more measured weighted more than another. Hopefully that questions makes sense. Thank you!",,1,,1,,1,,

I am a Dutch student in the last year of pre-univeristy stream and I made this recombination for a school project. I had to come up with a subject where I could work on for at least 80 hours. I choosed to do my project about 3D-printed handprosthetics that's why I eventually made this recombination.
It is based on two designs of the Enabling Community Foudation: the flexy hand and the unlimbited arm.
To make the perfect recombination I started with some research about 3D-printing and handprosthetics in general. And then I did some research about how the Enabling Community Foundation used a new technology to deal with real world problems. I found this very inspiring and I really hope that the community will grow and grow untill all children with needs are helped. I know it is kind of a very high goal ;). But in order to do so I think more people should get inspired by the community like I did. And that's the reason I am sharing my redesign.
So I'm curious if you like it :).
And If you wanted to know more about my project my research and my inspiration don't hesitate to ask. I would love to send you my 70 pages project even if i need to translate them for you.

Greetings

Hey everyone I'm running into a small puzzle... I have printed the K1 hand (100% scale) and I have begun wiring it up.  However in the model I used (and the model linked from the site) the forearm piece doesn't include the additional holes for post non-elastic knots along the backside of the bracer/wrist.

Does anyone have access or know where I can get the forearm STL for the K1 hand model with those holes?  Was this customized?  It would help close out the knots towards the back and not running along the bracer itself (which is a challenge without the knot moving).

Any advise? Thanks!

It is reposition-able into four positions determined by four notches.   To change the rate of closure the user just slides the CAM out a little to release it from the notch and rotates it to the next position. It is a little cumbersome to do while wearing the arm because this elbow design requires the CAM be on the inside. Still this works pretty well. I have showed the CAM in three of the four positions.

Also I have redesigned this arm to have two string bowden channels one to each elbow. So the thumb is one one elbow and the fingers are on the other elbow. By adjusting the closure rate of the thumb and fingers separately the wearer can achieve various grip types. 

Also I threaded the cuff itself. At 100% it is a 8mm-1.25 thread. The bolts are printed too so if the arm is resized the bolts a resized to fit. The only problem is I have printed the bolts vertically. Normally I put a flat side on the bolt and print them on their side for better strength.  Has anyone had problems with bolts printed vertically shearing because of bad layer adhesion? I can print these bolts on their side the nice big head just gets cut in half.

So I had mentioned quite some time ago that I was working a multi-material 3D printed anthropomorphic device that uses dual extrusion printing for enhanced functionality. It's been a while but I have finially finished the design and validation for graduation project (Masters in Industrial Design at TU Delft Netherlands)

So introducing here Ex-Machina prosthetic device that is anthropomorphic in function (as compared to the K-1 which is anthropomorphic in form and shape) using the principles of biomechanics to provide a truly 'opposable' thumb.

The whole finger (including knuckle - refer the orange finger picture in the photos below) is printed as one piece using a dual extrusion Ultimaker printer (upcoming printer) with the flex (filaflex from Recreus) printed together with the PLA. For the hand prototype here the pieces were printed with Ultimaker 2+ separately and then glued together but the design is proven to be printable with any dual extrusion printer (as long as you get the print profiles right!).

Key design element is that the thumb joint is placed in the device relative to other fingers just like the human hand. This also means there is less space for the user's wrist stump so the Palm section has to be slightly larger. Using the whippletree mechanism and gauntlet of the Pheonix as of now (160% size used here)

Looking forward to feedback from the R&D people and any users in this community.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JacquinBuchanan/posts/CNxk8Nukfoh,"Here is my first draft of the low profile gripper box. 

I drew the yellow string in by hand. The idea is the primary whippletree is a string through a curved slot and tied to the top of each of the tension bars. The tension bars slide freely in the dovetailed channels. The bottom of the tension bars have curved slots just like the original whippletree. The thumb string goes through a slot and is tied off.

I don't have any screws. I don't think they are needed. But this is my question to the community. Are the screws really needed? I realize no screws requires tying knots at just the right spot. But didn't think that was a real problem.

I could easily redesign with screws. The thumb can be another tensioner in a channel with a screw adjustment at the top. Likewise another channel could be added between the current two with a screw adjustment at the top. I only want to add the screws if they are really needed.

I am still making adjustments. In my first print the tolerances were too tight. The whole thing needs to be slightly larger. Getting the top string in is a little difficult. I am going to try and open that up a little. ",1,1,,1,,,,

Over the past few weeks it has come to my attention that there is spreading confusion regarding the ECF chapter process - who is maintaining them and how an entity becomes an officially recognized chapter. Please be aware of the following key points that should address these issues:

- In order to become an officially recognized ECF chapter you MUST be directly tied to an educational institution such as a college university or school
- Any entity that is not directly tied to an educational institution will fall under a different category of relationship with the ECF (this formal process is still currently being developed)
- There is an application process that can be found at the ECF Chapters Page on the ECF website PLEASE NOTE: The application is subject to review by the ECF Chapter Coordinator - Joe Fairley and ECF CEO - Grace Mastalli
- Currently we have only been working with US-based educational institutions but we are open to applications coming from international educational institutions
- Monthly chapter meetings for approved educational institutions will become available at the end of July
- The approval of our first officially recognized chapters will be made known on July 8th 2016

The benefits of becoming an officially recognized ECF chapter are as follows:

- Establish a nationally recognized entity directly tied to the Enable Community Foundation
- Benefit from the structure and coordination of how a chapter operates in order to better reach your recipients
- Establish good standing with your institution and provide them with validity for any needed support (financial space tools/materials advisement)
- Benefit from a monthly meeting with other chapters to ask questions provide feedback and innovative design ideas receive troubleshooting support
- Allow recipients to seek you out in a more organized and designated workflow be able to reach more people in an influential way

Please let me know what further questions you all have and make sure to be on the lookout for a couple posts coming from me soon regarding application approvals and the new monthly meetings with approved chapters.",1,,,,,,,

I just read the article that was posted by the team at Rice that had invented force testing tools for 3d printed hands. 
 
I was quite taken aback to read two quotes from team members of this group stating that in their judgment that the 3d printed hands that they had created (using E-Nable’s design !!!) were not sufficiently useful to recipients and that consequently the recipients of these hands eventually will end up discarding and not using their prosthetic 3d printed hands.
 
If those statements have any truth to them then in all good conscience and in the interest of full disclosure should not E-Nable’s web site include some kind of disclosure statement stating that there is a degree of controversy as to whether the hands are sufficiently useful to recipients ?
 
Below are the quotes from the two team members:
 
As Amber Wong explains “Children born without full hands are forced to adapt to the world and figure out how to go about their daily routines. If a prosthetic hand is not absolutely perfect in its function the child will probably discard it and return to his or her own adaptive ways.”
 
Team member Rachel Sterling says: ““If a kid has to put in five pounds of force to only get one pound of grip that’s a lot of lost efficiency because of how these hands are designed” says Rachel Sterling. “Until we reach a force efficiency of 100 percent the hands aren’t going to be useful.”

Greetings fellow e-NABLERs after 9 months with e-NABLE I have been offered a promising opportunity elsewhere which has been increasingly taking up my time.  It is to the point now that I've got to drop my e-NABLE work altogether and concentrate fully on the other opportunity.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+PeterBinkley5/posts/6ANhNWjXcNG,"I'd like to give a shout out to the good people at Ultimaker. https://ultimaker.com/

Over the last year they have donated several Ultimaker 2 printers and a bunch of money to e-Nable and asked for nothing in return. And they have been kind and supportive every step of the way.

When I met +Erik de Bruijn  (Co-founder) and +Sander van Geelen  (Community Manager) at the Hopkins e-Nable conference I was first struck by their friendliness and then their brilliance. Erik and I discussed some interesting solutions for e-Nable devices and by the next day he had already scripted a printable ratcheting mechanism in OpenSCAD and was ready to share it with me.

I can honestly say that their machines are mechanically awesome. Ultimaker machines complete print jobs very quickly and with excellent results. The Bowden-style filament feeder makes a very lightweight print head possible so high speeds don't rattle the box. They are also very easy and intuitive to use. I don't think I've read a single instruction for my Ultimaker 2 and I get consistently beautiful prints. But don't take my word for it read some reviews and note how they are ranked #1 in pretty much every recent consumer-level 3D printer shootout.

One morning a couple months ago I noticed my machine had a little broken piece so (even though the machine printed just fine) I contacted the company. They alerted their US hub who called me within 15 minutes and had a replacement part in the mail the same morning free of charge shipped for free. It arrived in my mailbox two days later. I've never encountered customer service that was so responsive and so generous.

You should also know that Ultimaker has chosen to pursue a completely open platform. Both the software and the hardware are open-source so when you get an Ultimaker you truly own it. I'd say that they are totally philosophically compatible with e-Nable or as close as you can get and still be a for-profit company.

And did I mention that they are really nice people too? 

So if you're thinking about getting a 3D printer you can feel good about getting an Ultimaker. If you have the money the Ultimaker 2 is the best of the best. If you want to spend less and assemble a kit the Ultimaker Original is also a very fast and accurate machine. I'd suggest getting the plus model with the heated glass bed.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/117596495829636702960/posts/TTTn6h9Fdmb,"Thinking about fingers ....

25 years ago I used to make a scorpion with a whipping tail - simple to make drill a hole through a piece of wood cut Vs in them that cut through the hole and thread a rubber band - the band pulls the faces of the v together ....

so I have been playing with fingers in the same way - and remembering conversations about the tensioner and how the tensioners get harder as the finger closes and wondering what would happen if I put the two together .... so I did :)

The basic principle is a finger with no mechanical fixing - two ninjaflex (1.75mm) filaments are run through the finger at the bend of the V and tensioned to hold the parts together - the tension gives the finger strength and the location of the tensioner returns the finger parts to have the joint flush. Using a pair means that the finger joint bends but does not rotate. When you bend the joint the filament stretches slightly but bends most - and pulls the joint back into alignment.

Then add a tendon and pull - and the finger rolls up.

Then move the tendon hole further from the joint and the action is easier

then leave the hole location where is  but scalop the opening (see the end) tso that the tendon gets a changing leverage advantage.

Then also scalop the tensioner opening so that it clips across the joint - WOW - this means that as the joint is closed the filament comes forward in the scalop and does not need to elongate just bends SUCH an easy movement. BUT - the sequence of closing is wrong - the end of the finger closes first - so then a hybrid which has the upper joint slightly harder (no scalop on the elastic) and the lower ones scalloped - this means each joint can be tuned to close in  a particular sequence.

So the point (and thanks for reading this far) was to lower the closing force but with a good joint action and the finger self opening. So I remember some tests by +Nicholas Hall and get out my luggage scales - to measure in newtons. Not an exact science but I took a 100% talon that I demo and had a reading of approx .3Kg - measured the option 1 = .6kg moving the cord = .4kg scalloping the tendon tube = .25kg scalloping the tensioner opening drops to almost nothing.

But the finger more or less returns to it's open hand position (a slight curve which is not too bad!

I am going to try to build a hand around this technology as it does several things

1) condsiderably lowers the force of actuation - even on these big clumsy fingers!
2) uses readily available tensioner (ninjaflex) which has amazing strength and you do not have to print it!
3) removes all snap pins
4) may allow fingers to have a simple attachment meaning they can be removed and replaces (with just the tendon needing threading)
5) could allow complex thumb action as you only need a pivoting surface - not a joint/pin
6) could allow you to pull the thumb out and into a new position - as the mechanism is just holes
7) would significantly reduce printing time - just accurate enough for surface finish and holes
8) no tensioner knots - I am just holding the tension with little pieces of electrical junction box connectors (2 small brass screws)

Not intended to be a finished solution but I have been working on this for a month and so had to get it off my chest!

Apologies for the really poor photos!

In this design the hinge point can be further away from the tendon lines which is great for grip strength and ease of actuation however more tendon travel would be required for the closing of the finger (especially with 3 joints) and therefore more wrist flexion is required.

This might be beneficial for the Limbitless Solutions style arms because more grip strength from smaller servos and it might be good for users with a large range of wrist movement too.

For those recipients with a small movement range who thinks it would be better to have a two jointed finger with the distal phalange slightly kinked like the e-NABLE hands or to have the tendon lines closer to the hinge point? Both options will use less movement to actuate.

It illustrates one way to invite corporate sponsors to host a branded view of a standard pipeline webservice that we provide (a variation of Hand-o-matic).  There are many other ways but this one picture illustrates two or three different paths that share one cool idea.

1. Field person (Médecins Sans Frontières Peace Corps ICRC a parent) takes measurements and pictures to upload.

2. Worldwide Aggregator (may need a person to augment the automated software in some cases) generates request package and dispatches to a pipeline maybe one of several pipelines or maybe more than one.  Could also be replicated by region to minimize shipping or warehouse 'Shoe Store' inventory.

3. A corporate Pipeline Host (who also sells filament) shows pairs of A & B pictures:  A needed a hand B printed it! followed by a list of not yet printed requests: A needs a hand printed B could be YOU?

4. Fabricator (B) signs up on that pipeline to print a hand

5. Fabricator sends/delivers it directly to the Field Person (5a) or back to the Worldwide Aggregator (5b) who does some sort of Quality Control check before sending it on to the Field Person.

6. After verification of success by the Worldwide Aggregator (maybe) Pipeline Host is notified to send a discounted spool of filament to Fabricator to thank them and encourage them to do it again for another request in the pipeline.

Variations:

The Fieldperson in 1 could use the Hand-o-matic print the hand and deliver it as is common today.  But we could make it easy to cycle through the hosted pipeline of their choice in order to earn a discounted spool of filament from the pipeline host.  The host will be happy to have more pictures pairs of people using their filament to print hands.

Similarly Filedperson in 1 and Fabricator in 4 could be co-located or at least know each other.",,,,1,,,1,

So I've been using the Raptor for a few days now and I'm gonna go out and say that it's pretty good. 

My first impressions were A: it's really cool looking and B: is pretty comfortable. 

The gauntlet:
Unlike the Cyborg Beast the interior of the Raptor is modeled after an arm. The gauntlet makes a nice low wide arch that doesn't pinch my arm but still conforms to it. However in contrast to the Talon the rigid structure of the gauntlet and tensioner makes for very responsive fingers. My sole complaint is that it feels to short. I feel like I lose some leverage from the single strap so close to my wrist. 

I would extend it back a few inches and as a matter of personal preference use a combination of leather and Velcro straps like the Talon instead of the single Velcro strap.

The unipalm:
The palm itself is very nice. It's sturdy and the holes are plenty wide for the cables. The cable guide easily goes far enough back that there's no chance of the corner digging into my wrist a problem we struggled with with the Talon in the past. However I can't help but feel that the whole palm is to long but that extra room would be useful for someone with more part the wrist than I have. After adjusting the Velcro I have about an inch and a half between my paw and the inside of the knuckles. My only other issue with the unipalm is again more with the Velcro. The ability to adjust to multiple residual hand sizes is nice but the attachment to only a few points in the upper palm make for a lot of pushing together and pulling apart of the Velcro and it 'stretches' away from the palm at anything challenging my grip.

The fingers: 
Again the fingers are plenty sturdy and they have a comfortable blocky bulk to them (that you could easily fit an entire Swiss army knife in). The action is very smooth and the gel grips go the fingertips snuggly as well and appear to confirm to their shape.

That being said I have two complaints about the fingers. The first one somewhat related to how smooth the action is is how LOUD the fingers are. Every movement is accompanied by the loose clicking and clacking of the finger parts rattling against each other. This may not be an issue in smaller models but at 158% it's highly pronounced. The next issue is that the cables haven't got much travel in them making for a grip without much torque. The strength is slightly more comparable to the Cyborg Beast than the Talon.

Overall:
This is a pretty good model and with a little more tweaking it could easily be our base hand we model everything off of. The design is open comfortable and lightweight. I'm looking forward to seeing where this design goes.",1,1,,,,,,

https://plus.google.com/u/0/110736851786370579318/posts/HqMy1HQ3JMt,"Test Hands: Our most powerful tool for innovation engagement and certification is currently being used as paperweight!

Requiring prospective volunteers to create a test hand performs two useful functions in the current system: validating that they have the technical resources and skills to create a working hand and giving them a chance to troubleshoot issues before a hand goes to a recipient. While these two things are valuable in and of themselves the resultant hand which required dozens of hours printing and work generally goes to waste.

There's a better way.

What if instead of those hands being used as paperweights they were sent to actual users who already have an e-nable hand? This confers some great benefits to E-nable  the volunteer and the recipient:

1. Benefit to E-nable:

A. Validation of Build Quality: As it currently stands prospective volunteers print to hand but there's really no validation mechanism to confirm that the hand is well-built. To my knowledge the hands aren't sent to some central lab. Setting up the logistics of such a scheme is an enormous effort unto itself. If instead test hands are sent to a recipient who already has a functional well-built hand the user himself (or his parents) are in the best possible position to confirm that the hand is functional. For example there is a fair bit of post-processing that needs to be done for a hand to work smoothly. Whether or not hand is working smoothly is not something that can be seen in a photograph. However a user that currently has a well tuned hand can easily compare whether or not the fingers are opening and closing smoothly without too much friction. Likewise if the hand falls apart in the first day of use that's  a pretty good sign to build quality wasn't very good!

B. Testing New Hands: New hand designs need to be tested. A great example is the FlexyHand 2 +Steve Wood. This brilliant design simply hasn't been deployed very much and there is a dearth of feedback on it. It's a brilliant design that should be tested. I'd like to see two dozen of these out in the field. A great way to get promising hand designs out in the field is to require prospective volunteers to build them as test hands and send them to recipient who already has a good functioning hand. Again there's no better person to evaluate a design than a recipient who is already proficient in using an e-nable hand. This is a really quick way to get real-world feedback on the design. If a kid has of Raptor Reloaded that he's been using for several months he's in a pretty good position to evaluate a FlexyHand 2.

C. Testing New Features:  Every couple of weeks someone comes up with an exciting innovation that everyone gets excited about. The trouble is no one actually implements it. A great example is the MEETZE-WOODS whippletree mechanism for adaptive grip. It only takes about 15 minutes to print one of these and 15 minutes to integrate it into a hand. To date I haven't seen one implemented on a Rator. The best possible person to evaluate whether or not in adaptive grip is a useful feature is a real user who also has a hand without it. Why not make volunteers integrate this into their test hand and send it to recipient who already has a hand is functioning well?

D. Testing Hand Performance: In the near future we will be testing hand for durability and functional performance with purpose built testing equipment. The hands used in the tests will need to come from somewhere!

Benefit to the Volunteer:

A. Practice Sizing a Hand to for a Recipient: One of the most difficult and challenging aspects of hand is actually fitting it to the user. Just printing a hand shaped test print doesn't prepare you for this. Volunteers should have the opportunity to try measuring a hand scaling a hand and using handomatic before they get a real recipient. Who better to validate that the maker is capable of fitting a hand properly than a recipient who already has a hand that fits well?

B. Real User Feedback: Volunteers will get real feedback from an experienced user on the the things they need to do to make better hands. Maybe the elastics were too tight. Maybe the fingers needed sanding. Maybe the Raptor wrist hinge wasn't at the user's wrist crease. This is important feedback for the volunteer to get before they make the first hand for a new recipient.

C. Engagement: Making a test hand is a ton of work. There is a real learning curve involved. Just the print time will be 20hrs. It's not terribly exciting to invest several dozen hours into a hand just to toss it in a shoebox under the bed. It's much more exciting for the volunteer to build a hand for a real child secure in the knowledge that if they don't get it 100% perfect the child has another hand. Would you rather print a paperweight or a build a brand new prototype for a real child that might later be deployed to children all over the world?

Benefit to the Recipient:

Fun: Let's face it it's fun to get new things. A big part of why E-nable is successful is that the hands are cool and fun. To keep kids engaged it's not a bad idea for them to be getting a new hand every 6 months or so.

Getting Improved Hands Faster: It may take a child 2 years to outgrow a hand but the pace of hand innovation is dramatically faster than this. The Raptor alone is on it's 3rd iteration after just 4 months of existence. Why should a kid wait 2 years to get the latest and greatest version?

Engagement and Compliance: Getting a new hand ever few months will keep kids engaged. It'll be exciting to try out a new hand and show it off to their friends. This is likely to keep them engaged an using the hand. Additionally it makes the child and their family part of E-nables growth and development; they're playing an important role in testing out new hands and new features that other kid's across the world will get to enjoy in the future.

At any rate that was the idea I had. Thoughts?

Just over two weeks ago my daughter was admitted to the hospital ICU. She got a rare strain of the cold that coincided with an asthma attack. It resulted in her left arm being paralyzed a general weakening of her core muscles and spinal nerve damage due to a viral infection and the pressure it caused. It's a very rare condition called 'Acute flaccid myelitis' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_flaccid_myelitis)

Only 20% of children who have gotten this have had a full recovery. Most have had very little if any. Which is why we have been looking for alternative treatments to complement the physical therapy and rehabilitation therapy we are starting to do. My daughter and I decided that it would be really cool if we would build a robotic prosthetic arm to help her arm move. Lorelei is super excited with this and over the past few days we have started to look into it. We are also researching various other possible treatments and we have received a lot of great advice so far and would welcome any other info that could help us. Lorelei is actively taking part in her own treatment helping me research and building her own arm she has been an inspiration to us all!

And this was when we found this community who are doing something similar.

  Great you printed a hand but is it up to snuff?  Did you know tensioning a hand is more of an art than a science?  Seeing an operational hand in person is like the difference between reading about a hand's operation and seeing a video of it in operation.  Being able to talk to a person who has produced a finished product is the Holy Grail of hand production.

   I just want to share an experience and encourage other new members to respectfully do the same if they can.  Recently I contacted the leader of my closest e-Nable group Eric Bubar at Marymount college in Va to see if I could meet with him.   I am very new to 3D printing with only 3 months of experience so I wanted someone with experience to look at my prints especially the hands to make sure I was on the right track.  Eric was very nice and luckily his current schedule allowed him to give me a tour of his lab.  I was very lucky with my timing; Eric was in a good position to to devote a couple of hours to answering questions and giving me some insights.  He also invited me back whenever his time allows because I think he sees that I appreciate the value of his time and will try not to waste it.
(NOTE: Be patient with your local contacts; they may have very busy schedules that make their replies slow. Putting ""New Local e-Nable Volunteer"" in your subject will help make your contact stand out above the spam of daily life.)
  I learned a lot of new things and I'd like to share them with the community in a series of upcoming posts. I'm trying to keep the posts relatively short to avoid a ""wall of text"".  In this post  I'd like to share the most important thing I learned:

WE ARE TOY MAKERS

   I in no way wish to insult our community or their hard work but this lesson is based on Eric's approach to dealing with clients. He said he does his best to lower expectations so no one is disappointed or injured trying to do something the device can't do.
  He said "" If you can't do it with one hand don't do it with an e-Nable device because it could fail"".  He also told me he had met a Dr. at a conference once who told him the devices we make are toys to which Eric in effect replied ""As long as we make the ""toys'"" limitations clear how can that be a bad thing?""  We aren't selling ""snake oil""  we are giving it away for free with a money back guarantee.
   Our homemade ""toys"" may not be as functional as professionally manufactured equipment but they do serve one very important function; they grant the wearer new self confidence especially if the device is tailored to the client's preferences in color and theme.  That alone can help change someone's life for the better. (Being able to toss a ball or hold a book doesn't hurt either.)
  Thanks Eric; this one thing has made me feel a little less trepidation about helping people in the future. Making a prosthetic was actually quite intimidating but making a functional ""toy"" that might only make someone feel a little better about their life is right up my ally.  This in no way makes me feel I can produce a shoddy ""toy"".  Far from it:  I want to make the safest toys I can because production cost and time aren't an issue.
   I'm proud to aspire to join the ranks of other ""toy"" makers out there trying to make someone's life a little more fun and if a little more function is a side effect so be it.
  As long as it is tempered with proper limitations to keep safety in mind I don't see any down side.

I have a recipient who is 31 years old who underwent a R) arm amputation about 3 months ago due to loss of blood supply following a burn contracture release. The amputation is through the elbow he has a small portion of his arm below the elbow left (about 2cm) but this is not really a functional joint at this point because it is so small so we are treating it as a through elbow amputation at this stage. 
The patient is a farmer. He must lift and carry heavy buckets and baskets of all sizes work cranks and machinery sort and stack corn. Many things that he carries are heavy and he must be able to hold plants while chopping with a machete. He also has a motorcycle that he needs to drive but that requires rotation of both wrists (which we understand will be unlikely in a basic prosthetic). Mostly we expect he will use his L) hand for most things and use the R) arm as a support.

I am so happy to find a group of like minded people looking to lend a hand. I bought an Anet A8 about two months ago to model parts for my R/C hobby. I am new to the world of 3D printing but I've had great success with my prints so far. My success reminded me of a story I read around 7 years ago about an engineer who traveled to Africa with a 3D printer to print limbs for victims of civil  war.  I tried to look up his story but I found e-Nable and the Dr. Craft's hand challenge instead. 

I have printed 4 Raptor Reloaded hands one is a120% RH in Yellow PLA made by BAMtack The other 3 are all printed in red ESUN PLA+ one is 140% LH ""Change Angle"" version with the thumb at a greater angle to allow the finger tips to touch more naturally. The other two are regular 120% LH and RH but while printing the RH model my thermistor worked partially out of its pit in the hot end. It was about a third of the way through and gave me a delaminated layer. Luckily I noticed a big difference between the hotend temp and the target temp before it got too far. I paused the print and fixed the issue but after the print I broke the hand at the delamination while removing it from the build plate.  I super glued the hand back together and marked the hand as a DEMO . It works fine but I would never donate such a shoddy product it still makes a great hand for demonstrations though. 

I have just finished building my 2nd Anet A8 and am in the process of debugging it now. I am also building enclosures so I can start printing higher temp plastics. I am hoping to be done by the end of the month. I am also working on finishing the hands so I can get all my badges in order I'm just not happy with my knot tying skills and fine tuning the grip yet.",,1,,,1,,,

There'll be plenty more late nights before we have a fully working product but I still have time for other more pressing projects.

Which brings me to e-NABLE. I tracked down Steve Wood; The designer of the Flexy Hand when I needed some information to help with the legs. Steve put me on to e-NABLE and the rest as they say is history. :-)

I have two 3D printers and three 3D scanners. They're not utilised 100% by any means and I'd be only too pleased to help out any projects with e-NABLE members. I'm pretty handy ( Ohh dear! ) as my hobbies have all involved working on complex mechanisms and I'm resourceful too. Throw me a challenge and see what I come up with!

All the best!

I know that this group is devoted to helping people needing prostheses but I hope you will take some time to read this post and provide suggestions. 

I am a veterinarian with a patient that has right forelimb paresis due to be hitting by a car and suffering permanent nerve damage. He is having a hard time keeping up on walks and playing with his family. I saw a youtube video about a dog named Derby who was born with bilateral forelimb paresis and the result is similar to that of my patient Toby except Toby is one sided. I thought that the prosthesis made for Derby would work well for Toby. After attempting to contact 3d systems several times and receiving no response I am seeking help advice assistance on helping Toby here. As a disclaimer the family cannot afford the conventional pvc pipe based carts etc. and there is no profit motive in this. I will not be charging them for this. I am more interested in getting involved in this area of work and perhaps one day being able to contribute to the work being done here.

Anyway sorry for the long post but looking for any advice help mentoring etc. on this how to get started? what equipment do I need can I ""virutally"" borrow a 3d printer? What materials would be best suited for this application etc. . .

A few weeks ago I had CNN-HLN on in the background as I was cleaning my home office and was inspired by a story about someone from E-Nable. The story was about 3d printing making prosthetics more affordable but the 'hook' on this particular story was that the person made it look like Iron Man's hand. I don't mind admitting I got a little choked up.  I started looking into the realities and misconceptions about 3d printing and the more I saw the more I was encouraged. Software wasn't thousands of dollars most of it is free now. Printers weren't $5k they could be found under a thousand. Also as steep as the learning curve is there is a very cooperative community. 

I was at the forefront of computing in the '70's desktop publishing and graphic arts in the '80's webpage design and publishing in the '90's and then I went into public speaking and event production. Besides my small ebay store and the occasional convention job I've mostly been a 'stay at home dad' with two children for the last 10 years. I did weeks of research and even stumbled upon a local meeting with a Shapeways representative at a new ""Maker Space"". I have a relative who has agreed to consult with me (he has been doing 3d design for 13 yrs and 3d 
printing for a while). I also have a good friend who is eager to assist me who is an engineer supervising quality control over industrial 3d prototyping 
and development.

I've built a team I've joined the groups I've ordered a FlashForge Dreamer and a variety of about a dozen plus types of filament. My family and I have been discussing what I should try to make as my official first print. Last night we decided on a raptor hand in a variety of colors and materials that will be assembled by my 9 year old son and 7 year old daughter. I plan to videotape the process and post it to my websites and youtube etc.
I am eager though to start working with someone locally that has a real need for a prosthetic. We live 10 miles from Disney World does anyone know anyone nearby that I could help?

CALLING ALL FABRICATORS! IF YOU HAVE A 3D PRINTER WE NEED YOUR HELP!

We need everyone's help to print Raptor Hand parts for the Johns Hopkins event! We only have a couple of weeks and we need to print a LOT of hands so we need everyone's help with this!

Here is a spreadsheet outlining all of the sizes and quantities needed. Just place your name in the column under the size you're printing and set the color of the cell according to the color you printed. The totals at the top will update automatically. Just for fun I added a ""Challenge"" tab showing who's making the most hands.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hSn2dm24C5Kgopu3jCbb8IEbVi9VWK3XakIhQQttvYM/edit?usp=sharing

All parts should be printed in PLA. Any colors are fine.

STL files can be found here: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7IZ4iPA1DJZWnVHN2RtdnB5WlU&usp=sharing

All individual STL files are scaled at default (100% scale) size. Scale each part up to arrive at the desired scale (i.e. to print at 125% scale all parts need to be scaled by 1.25).

The files with names that start with ""All parts..."" include all parts needed for a single hand and are already scaled to the size indicated in the file name. If you want to print all parts at once (and your build plate is at least 6x9"") there's no need to change anything - just slice and print.

Anyone can now offer to help with any case. We like the idea of the badging process in theory but in practice it has resulted in too few people getting involved in cases probably because they don't want to go through the process of getting the corresponding Credly badges. 

So for now we're going to rely on our volunteers to use good judgment about which cases to get involved with. For example if a volunteer has made a Raptor Reloaded and a Cyborg Beast that volunteer would probably have no trouble making a Phoenix hand even if he's never made one before and doesn't have that particular badge.

When multiple people offer to help on a case the person who created the case can review their profiles and see which badges they possess - so they'll still have the option of choosing the person with more documented experience. But this won't be enforced by the application at least for now. 

This update has now been rolled out.

The key point when pre-stretching the line is to put more weight on it then the line will receive in use but not enough to break it.

Has anyone tried anti-reflective coating/film over 3D scanner?

Recently while trying to achieve better positioning while scanning foot for Ankle-foot-orthosis I had troubles with my Sense scanner because light reflected against the glass through which I scanned. Scanning through glass gives loads of improvements for seeing actual pressure areas and helps to reduce manual after-modeling. But once lighting is not perfect - measuring results with 2 mirrored scans because reflected light projects as separate scan for scanner. 

I'm guessing if I can reduce artifacts and reflected images using Anti-reflective film over 3D scanners sensor.

Greetings. I have been interested in this project over a year now and I will soon be getting my own printer to start creating these devices. I have spent hours in this group reading and getting ideas on how about getting things started and who to get involved in this. 

I am living in the Czech Republic (In Prague to be exact) and I am trying to focus on getting parts to create these hands locally rather than ordering out of country. I have been reading up about the coverings used on the tips. More so the Lee Tippi Micro Gel Fingertips. I can not find them locally around and to order from Amazon would cause added cost and manufacturing time waiting for them to arrive. 

I have seen alternate posts here about using a heavy duty rubberized work glove that I will be looking into but I also remember seeing the following video and also some alternative finger designs. So  in the following video a person was making a replacement watch strap holder and soaked the PLA printer material in acetone and it made it a bit flexible and ""rubberized"".

I also noticed a couple of variant finger designs for the hands that have little nubs on the fingertips instead of the usual covers. I was wondering if anyone has tried one of the following: 

Take one of the fingers and spit it horizontally from midway to the bottom and soak it in the Acetone and see if it becomes more pliable and then attach it back to the finger. Or take one of the alternate designs with the nubs and and redesign it so the nubs prints out where there are small indents where the numbs used to be and the actual nubs print out separately then soak the numbs in the acetone and afterwards attach them back to the fingertips. 

I am curious to see if the parts soaked in the Acetone would help improve the grip so it might be able to be used as an alternative than the gel tips for those places where it is difficult to find them. I am waiting to get my Printer in the upcoming weeks and I will be trying this to see how it works out but I am curious if anyone else has tried this and also wondering if there would be an issue using this process when creating a hand for a child and the use of chemicals.

All mechanical assitive devices with body-powered mechanism have the risk to develop some symptoms of overusage - swelling redness bruses and fatigue. 

what i've analysed from most of open-source assistive devices for persons with partial hand defiencies the tightest spot is at wrist art. location becouse the 'wrist mount' part attaches from the inside to palm component.  Especially when these devices are custom scaled not adjusted to specific shape of residual limb it's important to make sure device is properly cusioned.

Scale cusion visely and ask for feedback!
6 month usage is far too long to notice symptoms of muscle fatigue.
1) Check if resistance of extension mech. is suited for patients - especially for short resisual residual limbs and young participants.
2) after short usage of device check if no redness is noticable so it don't get worse. 
It's allways cheaper to print another hand than realise the concequences. Quite often young participants are more excited about hand itself than noticing some discomfort.

This is a one-night foray into the leg prosthetic concept for my own personal use.  I have severe arthritis in my knees and at this weight it sure is tough to be vertical much less walk.  That has to change and fast.  

The weight is coming off slowly and steadily but those knees are not getting any better with the passage of time.  So rather than get knee surgery which really isn't an option yet I thought I'd toy around with designing my own leg support.

The biggest limitation of existing wrist powered e-nable hands is grip strength. I've heard anecdotally that many children have difficulty picking up a full can of soda. This is a problem not only because soda is delicious part of childhood but also because inadequate grip strength means the utility of the device is limited. We don't like talking about it but it's true.

We can tweak existing designs to reduce friction or elastic resistance (like +Peter Binkley  and +Peregrine Hawthorn have done brilliantly via push-pull bowden cables) but at best we can make the useful grip strength 20%-30% stronger through these approaches. To materially increase the gripping force by 100% or more there are 2 viable avenues: adding power to the device or adding mechanical advantage.

Powered Devices:

This is a area where many people are doing exciting work right now. Powered devices have tremendous potential but there many tradeoffs. Introducing electronics into the hands adds significant cost fabrication complexity weight and ongoing maintenance support while reducing the durability and reliability of the device. Given the tradeoffs inherent in powering devices the prospect of mechanically advantaged actuation is worth exploring.


Mechanically Advantaged Actuation:

Mechanically advantaged actuation offers the ability to increase the grip force by 100% to 500% limited only by the strength of the plastic joints and fingers not the child's wrist strength. It also allows the user to determine the optimal wrist position in which to pick an object up; no more 90 degree wrist contortions to pick up a pencil.

The principle is dead simple; rather than closing the hand all of the way with a single flex of the wrist a single flex of the wrist only closes the hand half-way but does so with 100% more gripping force. A ratchet mechanism saves the progress. Using such a device a child would be able to pick up large objects like a can of soda with only a single wrist flex; or small objects like a marble with two flexes of the wrist. A Obviously the mechanical advantage can be whatever the designer wants it to be; for a very small child with a very weak wrist 3 flexes for full closure might be the right ratio.

As mentioned above there is another significant advantage to this design that should not be overlooked; the user is able to decide what his wrist position will be when picking up an object. With current designs to pick up a small object like a marble a child must contort their wrist into a 90 degree bend. Try to pick up a pencil from your desk with your wrist bent to 90 degrees while seated; see how hard that is? Not only is it quite difficult to do it's also extremely difficult to maintain this position for any length of time. With a 2:1 or 3:1 ratchet mechanism the user can decide what position they want their wrist to be in when they pick up an object; this may add even more utility to a device than the extra grip strength does.

From where I sit if someone figures out how to integrate mechanical advantage into a hand it will easily be the most important innovation of 2016. If that sounds like hyperbole consider that it would give e-nable hands >100% better gripping power than the leading commercially available wrist powered product the M-Fingers from Partial Hand Solutions.

I could prattle on about the promise and potential of mechanically advantaged actuation but you hopefully your imagination is already starting to consider what e-nable hands would be capable of with 100% higher grip strength. It's way beyond my abilities to design such a device so I raise it as a design challenge to those of you out there with sharper modeling skills and keener minds. To my knowledge the original proposed design for adding mechanical advantage was posted by +Erik de Bruijn  (yes the Ultimaker co-founder!) in Sept of 2014. It was just a quick sketch but it's a very interesting start.

I'm IV. year student of orthotics/prosthetics from Latvia Riga Stradiņš university.

for most inspiration i've analysed ''raptor reloaded'' ''flexy-hand 2'' and ''exii hackberry''.

List of things I've been focusing on to improve model compared to others:
1)thumb opposition - ''cyborg beast'' thumb is not functional in grip so i sacrificed the size of palm(made it bigger) to make thumb in opposition;
2)phalanges - more joints between phalanges make more attrition so i made fingers with only 2 phalanges distal interphalangeal joint movement doesn't affect power of grip that much as efficiency of patient's strength to control the hand;
3)cable end/nail - one of the most common 'mistakes' for other models is that cable end hole is located in fingertip are - hiding hole under nail 'fixes' the problem of grasping as well it is more aesthetic because it gives opportunity to customize nails as patient wants without re-modeling fingers;
4)finger joint type - elastic band system(''raptor hand'') takes a lot of space in fingers which could be replaced with sensors etc.
ninjaflex joints work fine but the composing is quite a mess to fit the thick end into palm and didn't made a trust in me so i choosed the torsion springs for finger extension. It is more costly than other two methods(20(for two hands) torsion springs costs 60 EUR but it should work faster easier composing of fingers.
5)palm surface - ABS/PLA plastic is hard and slips over most of the materials so the grip is slippery as well.  
Palm surface attrition affect power grip of hand so i cut special socket for power grip to easily grasp handlebars broom etc.(see photo with printed green palm above thermoformed plastic cover)



I've been using following software/hardware:
Scan - Structure sensor with Skanect software combined with iPhone5 
Scan smoothing fixing - Autodesk meshmixer
CAD - Autodesk fusion 360
Slicer - Craftware( best interface and support generating options i have discovered by far)
3d printer - Mass Portal Pharaoh ED (made in Latvia)
3d printer settings:
ABS - 240-250/110-115 C
0.4 nozzle; 0.1 layer height;
speed: 20-80mm/s (matters of part i am printing supports get messy if printed at high speeds)

What works and what doesn't?

my expierience:

In Latvia there is only one enterprise which works with industrial 3d scanners. Sadly after trying to scan 7 y/o boy's hand it was not possible becouse kid's hand was shacking(moving not much but enought to make trouble for scanner) no matter of fixing and was not able to get 360 degree picture.

So i tried different way using Kinect(1st gen)(X-box camera for motion reading) together with Skanect(software to make Kinect as scanner). teacher from my university has allready tried it with feet and results were pretty good. But appearantly after 2hr trying hand was too complex to be scanned.
Point to notice: there is Kinect 2 out in the market but i haven't found software which cooperates for my needs.

Right now luckly after long discussions University has bought 3d Scanner but as allways there is no one who can set it up or know how to use it so it' s behind locked doors.(don't think anything will change in further 2 months)

so my only options i see is either:
1)to find out some awesome app for phone
(maybe this - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autodesk.Catch)
or
2)cooperating with some clinic and try to convert computertomograpie data to some data type which is 3d editable.

Have you tried last two or maybe succesfully done previously written down two's?

I have used the big four free slicers out there Skeinforge Slic3r Cura and Kisslicer. But recently I have started using a new free one that has just come out by the name of CraftWare.

I am absolutely blown away by this one for it's simplicity great graphics lightning speed and the interactive support feature is just awesome.

The slicing speed is near instantaneous so fast you think you haven't hit the slice button properly.

The interactive support feature allows you to remove bits of the auto generated support or add extra pillars in. You can build a tree like structure up should you wish like Meshmixer's support feature.

Everything is saved in a single project file so settings stl supports can all be shared easily.

Give it a try it's completely free and you might be as blown away as me : http://www.craftunique.com/craftware

I'm a high schooler in Lamar Colorado and I'd love to share my biggest project. E-nable was a huge starting point for the research although the physical design is all mine.
In the last year+ I've designed and built a prosthetic arm from the ground up. It's completely 3D Printed with the exception of the electronics inside. The Stampede Arm is designed to have full functionality and be perfectly sized for under $350!
At the Colorado State Science Fair last April I took home Honorable Mention in Engineering along with 3 special awards and a scholarship to Adams State University (Alamosa Colorado)!
I've done tons of research and work towards this project so far and I plan on continuing it into the next several years. I'd love to get a conversation going and share my ideas and work with the world. If you've got any questions please feel free to comment!

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JonSchull/posts/8rPCRjFn717,"Let's start talking about Expenses Fund-raising and Marketing  (inspired by Katharine Juul) 

 Robohand  tells us the cost of a hand is $500.  It's not clear if that's cost of materials or materials plus consulting customization fitting etc.  Nor is it clear if the rest of us will need to charge more less or at all ( Markette Pierece and Albert Marano)  envision incorporating this effort into educational programs.  Those programs might minimize  costs to clients OR they might somehow fund the educational programs from Robo Hand revenues.  All TBD.  

Regardless if our venture succeeds we will probably want to make our financial and legal practices transparent.

Another issue I'd like to understand is the conditions under which medical insurance could underwrite this effort.   Our methods are probably an order of magnitude less costly than those of traditional prosthetic programs.  That's a big value-add (as they say in the business world).  How can we capture some of that value to fund our efforts

We are a Senior Design Group at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in Rochester NY doing a project on the e-NABLE hands to measure the grip strength. This data will be used to compare designs and lead to stronger hands in the future.

We are reaching out to the e-NABLE community to try to get in contact with people in the prosthetics industry that may be able to assist us. If there are any prosthetists/physicians that would be willing to share information about industry standards on grip strength testing techniques/devices that would be greatly appreciated.

We are also interested in how non-prosthetic hands are tested since that could be a potential method as well. Any information/ideas will be helpful.

Thanks for your time!

As of this morning those of us formerly participating in the Strategic Planning Committee (SPC) created by Jon in April 2014 began the transition away from that meeting to a new weekly Town Hall meeting instead.  You are invited to participate via HOA starting next Friday May 1.  The invite will be posted sometime next week. 

This morning we had a dry-run Town Hall meeting without the Town!  Here is the roll-out plan:

 - 4/24 Town Hall dry-run (recorded); invited old SPC members plus Sarah Maria Caren
 - 5/1  Town Hall with moderated Q&A; same invitees 
 - 5/8 Town Hall with moderated Q&A; any team from community may get on the agenda up to a maximum of 10 people reporting out at a single meeting. 
 - 5/15 5/22 etc. repeat each Friday 

As you can see from the written minutes from today (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iou-xv1V6KpUA754pYaNxE-1jOyx3aEELMDT0_wa5-Q/edit?usp=sharing) the current format is a 5 minute report on each topic with any one person reporting for 5-10 minutes tops including questions if any.  The idea is to keep the meeting to one hour.  This way any team with progress they want to share should have a chance to do so once or twice a month in this Town Hall HOA.  I'm hoping we'll hear from e-NABLE Haiti OST Handomatic and other teams I might not even know about on 5/8 or one of the subsequent weekly Town Hall meetings.

I don't have a 3D printer or know how to use one but of course the minute after I signed up for access to the community my next stop was Amazon to take a peek at the printers....  Anyhow if there is anything I can do to help in the Rochester area please let me know.  If there are any opportunities to stop by RIT and learn more or see a printer in action I'd love it.

OK we've settled on a name for our new offspring! The Raptor. Now we need your help with printing for the Johns Hopkins event!

The term ""raptor"" is derived from the Latin word rapere (meaning to seize or grasp).

Everyone's feedback has been tremendously helpful. We've incorporated a couple of fixes already but we want to be very careful about making further changes until after the Johns Hopkins event so some of the suggestions may be saved for later implementation.

We now want to ask for your help in printing parts for the upcoming Johns Hopkins conference. +Jen Owen and +Melina Brown (+Enable Matcher) are working on gathering sizing information for the recipients attending the event. We're building a spreadsheet to track those and we'll need people to print the Raptor design in those specific scales once we have the details ready.

Meanwhile we also need to print as many Raptor hands as possible at 130% scale. This will be for the other workshop where medical practitioners learn to assemble the hands so they don't need to be a particular size. 130% is small enough to fit on a single build plate but large enough that it's not too hard to assemble.

Please print in PLA - any color is fine. We suggest a 0.2mm layer height and 35% infill.

We're going to ask that you send your prints to Johns Hopkins prior to the event. A shipping address will be provided shortly.

Remember - no need to assemble. Just print the parts and ship them out.

The files are still available here: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7IZ4iPA1DJZWnVHN2RtdnB5WlU&usp=sharing

If you have a 6x9"" build plate (or larger) and if you're feeling courageous you can use the ""All parts at 130% single build plate.stl"" file to print everything at once. Otherwise all of the individual STL files are available as well.

We're not going to publish the files publicly until after the Johns Hopkins event so please don't share these outside of e-NABLE for now.

I am a 59-year old widowed woman who has been physically challenged since birth. I was born missing my left arm below the elbow. At the time in the mid- to late 50's I was the youngest child to be given a prosthetic. I had all kinds of great therapy at NY Hospital starting at about age 3. When I turned about 13 I realized that I could function better without the prosthetic; they were not at all functional back then. So for the past 46 years I have been doing everything without one. However since my husband passed away in 2008 I find that there are a few things that could be done easier if I had a prosthetic. My dilemma now is that I have become disabled due to a chronic illness. My income is limited to my SS disability. That does not give me extra funds to get a regular prosthetic. I also am realistic enough to realize that a full length prosthetic would require a fair amount of rehabilitation therapy since it would add more than 12 inches to my reach. When I heard about your project using 3D printing from Solidoodle I thought this might be a great option for me. All I need is a prosthetic hand to wear on the small part of my left arm below the elbow. I just need to be able to hold nails or screws while I do repair and projects on my small farm. I would greatly appreciate your consideration of my request. I realize that your project deals with children but perhaps extending this to adults could help people like me or even returning veterans who are amputees. I hope you will contact me to discuss the additional applications for your product. I would be very happy to be the person who makes this new option available to the many people in need.

I've been messing around a lot with a design I'm making from scratch but decided at least for the immediate future to construct a modified version of David Orgeman's second degree hand combined with the partial finger replacement  by Ivan Owen. The original models which I derived  can be found on Thingiverse if anyone is curious.
  You can see in the background of the picture I took of some parts how much support was used. Since was the biggest supported print I've ever done I was really surprised how well Slic3r handled it.  This did make me think however that in the distant future I'd like to redesign some of these more universal gauntlet parts to instead be made of smaller strips of plastic connected to some underlying cloth and padding.  The result would be a flexible wrist attachment which could be printed on small printers and without much support if any at all.  I think a lot of people could really benefit from this given the number of people who have little printers like the printrbot Simple.",,,,,,,,

What an excellent idea this
I've been using this as a dowel pin replacement. Instead of making the ends of the pieces a tight fit I just melt the ends of the spike and it sticks

The idea was to use this in the proof of concept stage and in the end use proper hardware

Which brings me to my question. With the new Taulman3d nylon filaments that are available now wouldn't this method make a nylon spike that is much stronger than ABS or PLA...?
Any reason that the same process might not work with nylon?

When a user closes the hand there are three possibilities:
1) the distal part curls in first followed by the mostly or completely curled finger curling at the metacarpal-phalangeal joint into the palm
2) both joints curl at the same time
3) the finger stays straight and folds in towards the palm followed by the distal section curling

From my observations 1 happens the vast majority of the time - 2 happens some of the time - 3 happens pretty much never.

The problem is both 1 and 2 cause problems for grasping an object.  The fingertip gets pulled in and interferes with getting the object into the palm.  I would think 3 is the ideal.  The fingers should fold at the metacarpal-phalangeal joint until the pads of the proximal phalanges contact the object.  Only then should the intermediate and distal curl in to tighten the contact.

Am I missing something?

I think it is possible to tweak the fingers to make them act as I describe - to make 3 the most common behavior.  I want to be sure though that I have not overlooked something in my analysis.  I do get that this would make it harder to pick things up by pinching against the tips of the fingers.  I think that could be accommodated if it is just an occasional need more than the standard.

Can't find the original post so I'm writing a new one

Your spring loaded tensioner has a lot of potential beyond the extra few mms of motion . Especially in the future when we start to use double jointed fingers. The hand could comfortably take the form ofwhatever its holding

If the spring deflection is around the same as the travel length of the tendons (open to close) then this adaptive grip could be achieved

I'm thinking an extension spring instead of compression might allow for a more compact design

The downside of running with this is
1. The grip strength will be equal to the rating of the spring
2. The spring selection will be on case by case basis (and changing even for the individual)

That being said I feel like there might be a manner of calculating which spring to use

Would it be possible for example to measure the grip strength of the child's normal arm derive the load on each finger from there and then calculate which spring to go with
Or would it be possible to do a study and define the spring based on sex and age groups?

It'd be nice to get some feedback from the experts in the group on this",,,,,,,,

Check out the way the flexible cords are tied off at the fingertips. I think that's genius!

I've had a lot of difficulties with both the flexible and non-flexible cords when trying to use the method of just tying knots at the end. The knots tend to get pulled through the holes unless they're exactly the right size. I've switched to using ""6/2 seed beads"" for the non-flexible cords. I tie the bead off at the end then the bead fits into the fingertip but won't fit through the smaller channel so it holds the cord securely. But I haven't been able to find beads with a large enough inner diameter to fit the flexible cords while still fitting inside the appropriate channel.

With David's approach there's no chance of the cord being pulled out of it's anchor spot from excessive tension. The second photo shows how the flexible cords are then tied off behind the knuckle block (you can see them behind the non-flexible cords).

I just wanted to call attention to this as it would be great to see this incorporated into the Cyborg Beast or other designs. [hint hint... +marc petrykowski +Maker Block +Laird Popkin]    ;)

Many of the pictures show it in a not quite complete state - the pictures don't show some final medical foam and velcro for example - but it is mostly all there.  There are a couple of videos in the gallery on Thingiverse where you can see a couple of the features.

The hands biggest feature is two degrees of freedom based loosely on a design idea from +Bob Roth .  The wrist has a gimbal to allow ulnar-radial flexion in addition to the standard motion.  It does not much change the way the fingers close like Bob was trying but it does provide a great deal better freedom of motion for the user.

This also has the sprung tuners I wrote about earlier.  You can see them in action on the thing page.

There are a lot of other improvements from the first version that will not be so obvious.  For example I made the neutral position slightly flexed upward and adjustable based on input from some in the medical profession.  I also lifted the strings away from the wrist pivot point so that the fingers could close with less of a severe hand angle and so that the strings would not rub against the user's wrist.

As always it is fully parametric OpenSCAD.  I made the code a lot better in this version.  I separated out most of the key parameters to a separate file to make it easier to build a consistent set of parts.

We talked about modification of one of the existing designs for enhanced functionality (our conversation focused on the Cyborg Beast but others may work fine as well).

Through our discussion David proposed two possible changes to the Cyborg Beast which would result in additional functionality for an already great design.

1) Change the tensioner design so that bending the wrist down or up will cause the fingers to grasp. The downward bend would be used more for delicate maneuvers while the upward bend would be more of a strength grasp. This way when using the stronger grasp for example when lifting a heavier object the wrist would be in a better position to reduce risks of carpal tunnel syndrome.

2) Add a rotator “cuff” at the back of the gauntlet which when turned would cause the thumb rotation to be adjusted. This would allow the user to easily switch between various grasp types while still using a mechanical design without electronic components.

A third change was also discussed having to do with optimal resting position but that was just because I didn't have the cables on my demo Cyborg Beast tuned quite tightly enough.

The two modifications above seem achievable and even to my comparitively uneducated mind it does seem like it would improve the range of things that could be done with the device.

+David Dietz I did my best to sum up what I understood but please jump in and provide any clarifications you can.

I've captured a copy of these notes in a document which I invite anyone to start adding to...

I could handle the project management role or I'd be happy to hand it off if anyone else who wants to take it on. It would be the same deal - everyone's welcome to contribute in any way they like...

Gauntlet design:
Had a couple of questions bouncing around my head for a bit
Maybe the experienced designers here can help clear things up

1- Is there a distinct advantage or disadvantage associated with the length of the gauntlet? ie. torque or more tendon extension? I've thought that the gauntlets could be reduced in length without affecting anything. But then +Bob Roth's design had the connection way up the forearm so maybe I'm mistaken....

2- Are the straps the only thing that hold the hand in place? I don't mean when just bending the wrist. Would the kids be able to use their hands to lift or hold heavy things? Or would the hand slide off if they try. In the case of my daughter even the sleeves of her clothes slide over her wrist.....

That being said moving the gauntlet up to where Bob had it might help in this regard. Maybe if it's fastened up where the forearm muscles begin the curvature there will hold things up?

In assembling several Cyborg Beasts I came across a couple of opportunities for improvement. First using knots at the end of the non-flexible cords would sometimes result in the knot slipping through the hole even after tying multiple knots. Second I noticed that the non-flexible cord recommended in the instructions started to fray at the places where it rubs against plastic parts while moving.

To solve these issues I found some nice 100lb test fishing line on Amazon which I use for the non-flexible tendons. And I tie each one off to a small bead that fits into the fingertip - much more secure than using a knot.

This is a change I am making to the tuners on my Second Degree hand.  There will be a shield over the springs - so the tuner will just look a bit longer than usual.

The problem this is trying to solve is related to grasping an irregular object.  When you close a mechen hand all the fingers pull at the  same rate.  Now imagine that the index finger has hit the object and cannot move any further.  At that point either the index tries to continue closing and crushes/breaks the object or the index and all fingers stop so the other fingers do not get proper contact and the grip is poor or the hand breaks.

In the pictured solution the springs are selected such that they will not compress with the normal line tension for closing the fingers.  Once a finger is stopped however the springs then compress to absorb additional wrist flex.  That means that the other fingers can continue to close on the object without a stopped finger putting too much pressure (either on the object or the hand).  This doesn't give you a ton more motion (maybe 7-10mm more once a finger has been stopped) but it is enough extra to be noticeable.

Simple solution.  I feel kind of silly that I didn't think of it sooner.  Only hard part is finding just the right springs.  They have to be just the right diameter and strength.  That said I was able to find these ones just grubbing through an old box of springs in the basement.  I have tested them tied to a new hand and they work fine.",,,,,,,,

https://plus.google.com/u/0/110257220895777457001/posts/bRBZZjSJxpU,"This weekend I gave Chris version 1 of her hand.  She was quite pleased with it and is starting to learn to use it.  She will have a steep learning curve because she has had a lifetime to develop ways to use her thumb.  Since she does not have fingers she struggled with making the opposing motion.  Most of her adaptations involve more of a pinching motion against her palm.  She is so adept at getting by with just the thumb that she will probably not use this much other than as something to play around with but she wanted to give it a try.

What's good about this version:
*  The fingers are the same length as those on her other hand - which makes for a very natural looking hand.  Although there was some question about if having those varied lengths would impact ability to grasp objects that does not appear to be a problem.
*  The fingers include 3M gripping material that has made the grip of the hand very good.
*  The hand is open on the thumb side to allow Chris to use her thumb while still benefiting from the mechen fingers.
*  The knuckle block uses a neat hidden nut trap to allow a really good proximal joint using standard M4 button head screws.
*  Uses the original prototype of the string adjuster to allow tweaks to the individual finger tensions.

What isn't so good in this version:
*  I used set screws for the intermediate-proximal joint.  Screws are just lousy for finger joints.  They are not under the tension that all screws need to be effective - so they move by themselves.  I used thread lock to make them work for now.  Version 2 already has been made to use some very nice 5mm printed pins.
*  There were a lot of screws into acorn nuts in various places.  Again screws are lousy.  To make that work you really need to tighten a standard nut and then lock it with an acorn nut - and that becomes large and unwieldy.  Version 2 integrates some parts to eliminate some of the screws and otherwise tries to trap the nuts to improve the situation.
*  The rubber dip on the finger tips did not turn out very clean.  In part that is because I already had the fingers on the hand when I dipped them.  In part it is because of how the string and bungee came through and was bound.  Version 2 will not have strings or bungees coming out of the finger nail or tips and I will be able to dip the fingers before final stringing.
*  It would be good to open the hole a little more on the web portion of the thumb.  It was a bit of a tight fit there.  It might be a bit tricky to open that much but I think I can get a few more millimeters freed.
*  The closure for the hand and arm sections are pretty primitive.  Chris didn't want me to spend a lot of time working on those parts because she wants to work on it to make it something that will work for her.


All told I think this was a good start.  It was more of a project than I expected when I took it on.  I originally thought I was just going to download the Robohand parts from Thingiverse and print them.  It has proven to be a bit more involved than that.

I am now hard at work on the next version.  I expect that one will be a big jump ahead of this first attempt.

win some - lose some...

I have been playing around lately with ways to improve how the bungees connect.  I thought I had a really clever solution.  To be fair it was sort of clever... but it didn't work at all.  Although that solution didn't work I fell back to what I still consider an improvement.  I will outline both the failed version below (so that others don't need to repeat my mistakes) and also what I am doing on version 2 of my fingers.

The solution that I thought was clever involved a mechanism to allow any individual finger to be re-bungee'd and tensioned - in place without any disassembly and without any impact/dependence on any other finger.  The start of this was to include a tie-off for the bungee on the intermediate portion.  You can see that in the first picture.  I have improved this a bit in later versions.  Although this was part of the failed solution it is a part that worked so I am still using it on my next fingers.  The bungee then threaded through the knuckle block to a small indent.  A piece of printing filament was cut to sit in that indent.  One strand of the bungee went on one side of the filament rod and the other strand on the other.  They were then tied together with a surgeon's knot.  So far so good.  I built a test part and sure enough it could be easily cabled in place.  What is more tying the knot at approximately the right tension was easy because now both ends of the cord were free to make the knot.

The reason for all of this was that it provided a couple of ways to adjust tension.  If tension was way off you could stretch out the rod and take another loop of cord around it before returning it to its slot.  You could then do fine adjustments by pulling it out and twisting it.  The idea was to make it work sort of like a torsion catapult.  Twisting did sort of work - in that it allowed a pretty precise control over the bungee tension.  The problem though was that the twisted bungees then had exposed ridges from the twists - and they caught in all kinds of places.  Because the bungees need to slide through the proximal joint the catching was a show stopper.

I don't think there is a reasonable way to make this work.  I already expanded the hole sizes as large as they could go without it making any difference.  I thought briefly about maybe using some sort of sheathing around the bungees but thought that going that route was resulting in too complex of a solution.

That all said using the tie-off point on the intermediate finger and then tying off to a post at the knuckle block still has a lot of benefits.  As I see it the benefits are:

  *  No bungee hole in fingernail so the finger prints better.
  *  No loose bungee end to secure through fingernail so no possibility of the bungee end slipping into the hole and changing tension.
  *  No loose bungee end out of fingernail needing to be bound down so no odd bumps in the rubber coating because of the bungee end.
  *  Able to replace a failed bungee quickly without replacing or removing a finger.
  *  Able to individually tension each finger rather than having the tension in two fingers linked together.
  *  It is possible to tie a good knot (surgeon's knot) since neither end of string is under tension during tie-off.
  *  It is very possible to set finger tension by pulling up the first double overhand portion of the knot and then checking tension before doing the second lock knot.
  *  Bungee run is shorter and more direct making for less abrasive wear points or places where the bungee could bind.
  *  Elastic load is shared by two runs through the proximal joint making it stronger and less prone to failure.

On the negative side:
  *  Bungee is more exposed at the intermediate attachment point.  I have set the rod down a little to reduce this but it is still more exposure than when going out through the fingernail.
  *  Two runs of bungee means the hole in the proximal joint needs to be larger and it could become a problem for small fingers.  My tests are generally adult sized.  I have a lot of room left but maybe it would be a problem with very small hands...


I am probably going this route for the next hand I make for Chris.  If any of you have any feedback it is always welcomed.  I have also made the fingers increase in height as you go from tip to knuckle block.  That looks a bit more natural makes the fingers stronger and provides a slight leverage advantage over the last version.  I am also going to modify these to allow pins as an option in the proximal-intermediate joint.  I think pins are a better solution than screws.  Happy to discuss why if anybody cares...  I also improved the shape of the intermediate portion to make it better accept 3M gripping material that I thought made a crazy big difference in the grip for the first hand.

I will as always post the parametric scad files for these.  Just like with the previous version you can set a bunch of customizations - like the length of the digits.  They aren't out yet because I am still tweaking a little.  If there is any feedback that leads to improvements I would like to get that incorporated before putting them out in the wild.

Sorry about the length of the post.  Nobody ever accuses me of being overly brief - or even appropriately brief...

https://plus.google.com/u/0/110257220895777457001/posts/DBUCdvdx69f,"Bungee issues.

I have run into a number of issues with the bungee cords that return the fingers to a straight position when not flexed.  I am wondering if others have run into these same issues.  I have solutions I have started to implement but I am not convinced they are the best possible.  So I am also wondering if anyone has other possible solutions.

First the issues.  I started out with a bungee with a knot in one end threading down through a finger then through holes in the knuckle block then back up the neighboring finger - pulled tight and another knot to hold it all in place.  My problems with this (as I understand it fairly standard setup) stem at least in part from the fact that this is an adult hand with relatively long fingers and I have made them match actual finger lengths (so they are not all the same).  Because the fingers are long the tension on the bungees needs to be relatively high or they will not return to the straight position.  When the tension is high however the bungees tend to pull into the holes in the finger tips - the knots won't stop them.  Also using one bungee for two fingers means the return tension on each is the same.  When the fingers are different lengths this doesn't work.  A tension strong enough to return a short finger leaves a longer neighbor sagging.  Tighten enough to hold the longer finger and the shorter one is so tight that it does not want to bend at all.

Now my solutions - which might be incredibly suboptimal but I wanted to get out there for discussion... 

For the first problem I used a separate bungee cord for each finger.  I tied a simple slip knot in the end and looped it around the finger tip.  I then drew it tight with the ends positioned so that the knot sits in the string hole.  There will eventually be string wrap over the tip with superglue holding that and then everything past the bungee loop will be dipped in rubber.  I think this part of the solution is actually pretty good.  The bungee is completely unable to move - the end being very securely locked in place.  The string/glue/rubber should help further hold and protect the loop around the finger.  In fact the slight bump the loop adds might even give a minor improvement to grip.  That all said I would be interested if anyone sees any issues with this. solution.

Now the part about which I am most concerned.  Because I have a separate bungee for each finger I now need a way to secure them under tension.  What I did was to add four small holes to the knuckle block.  I bring each bungee through the knuckle block as normal and then go through the new hole and do a simple knot.  I am able to set the tension on each bungee individually - so that all of them return to straight and each takes about the same force to curl.  I have let the hand sit for about a week and the bungees did not seem to lose tension.  That however is my fear.  The knot I am using is very simple and I am not convinced that it will not just slowly loosen and release.  The space makes it very hard to tie a really good knot and the fact that this is elastic rather than normal string/rope makes almost all knots questionable anyway.  There is not a lot of room on the knuckle block so it is difficult to make clamping terminals or anything like that.  Anyone have any thoughts on this?  Any better ideas?  I really am a bit uncomfortable with how this is going to hold up.  If there is a better solution I would rather figure it out before I finish up the fingertips.

You can set the number of tuner rods set the size to M2 M2.5 M3 (or the exceedingly unlikely M4 or M5) can adjust the length of the rods can adjust the size of the hole for the string and can set the clearance for the tuners.  You can select if you want to generate just the tuners or just the block or both - but you have to use 0 to generate and 1 to skip.  (The original OpenSCAD used true/false but that wasn't working so well in Customizer.)  You should also be able to set the hole sizes to match custom ones (like non-metric sizes) if you use the OpenSCAD file directly.

Just like Ivan's version this one does not include a mount.  It creates only the block.  You would then either create the stl and mash it up with the mount you want or you can incorporate the OpenSCAD script into the mount.

Hello folks!

If anyone would like to make use of this I've released a cable tensioner on Thingiverse. Thank you to Frankie and David; the ideas on tensioners that you shared were the basis of this design. Since this could be applied to mulitple designs I made it without any mounting hardware. Instead the STL file for the block can be imported into design software and then attached to a base which is what I did with Peter's cable anchor base in the picture. I used Tinkercad to remove the set-screw setup that was there imported the tensioner block and added it to the design and exported the result.

Here is a video explaining the tensioner: http://youtu.be/lO3zUPWro5A

I received a package of this material and have applied some of it to Chris's hand.  It definitely adds a lot of extra grip over the plain plastic parts.  I have used it to add gripping pads to the proximal and intermediate phalanges.  I think this will be beneficial since the fleshy portion of those fingers provide a lot of grip for a full hand.  The proximal pad is one solid piece and provides a lot of value.  The intermediate portion needs to be split to allow the drive cord room to move and also needs to be a bit smaller because of how the fingers curl.  Given that the intermediate is maybe a bit more tenuous and might be more likely to come off.  With both of those pads though the grip of the fingers is notably better.

The adhesive on the stuff at first look seems pretty strong.  I had to remove one set of pads and it did not come off easily - which is encouraging.  Only more testing will tell if the adhesive is sufficiently strong for continuous use.  If it turns out that the adhesive fails 3M does have a version without adhesive (intended for sewn on applications I guess).  It might be possible to use that with a stronger adhesive.

I cannot think of a way to use this on the fingertips such that I would have confidence in it.  I have tried too many types of fingertip bandages without any success.  I am thinking I will still dip the fingertips in rubber but then use this TB400 to add more grip like I have it now.

I did get more of this material than I am likely to ever use.  +Peregrine Hawthorn you mentioned that you wanted to try this stuff.  If you message me your address I will send you a sheet of it to experiment with.  +Francisco Fernandez I can probably send you a sheet as well though I probably need to know the best way to send it to Spain.

I wanted to ask the community opinions on the optimal drive string for these hands.  For my initial test builds I have been using 100 lb test braided fishing line (Spectra PowerPro).  I chose that because of some experience with it in the 3D printing world.  The stuff is insanely tough and unlike normal fishing line hardly stretches at all.  It occurs to me however that those properties might not be the ideal.  For instance maybe a little bit of stretch in the drive strings is a good thing.  Anyone tried using something similar?  If so did it work well or is there maybe something better?

Click here for the link to Zion's story

Dear Nobles   
We are proud to announce that Shriners Hospitals for Children® was part of a team that made medical history earlier this month. Chief of Staff Scott Kozin M.D. and Dan Zlotolow M.D from Shriners Hospitals for Children – Philadelphia were part of a multidisciplinary medical team that performed the first-ever pediatric bilateral hand transplant by successfully transplanting donor hands and forearms onto eight-year-old Zion Harvey.   
When Zion was referred to Shriners Hospitals for Children Dr. Kozin and colleagues quickly recognized that Zion was a potential candidate for this transformative procedure making him the first patient to receive a pediatric hand transplant in the world. In keeping with Shriners Hospitals collaborative approach to care Dr. Kozin worked together with Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania to assemble a 40+ team of medical experts to perform this complex and demanding 12 hour procedure.    
Zion is a bright and precocious eight-year-old who has told his doctors that he cannot wait to someday throw a football and climb on the monkey bars. Shriners Hospitals looks forward to continuing our support in Zion’s recovery and goals.     
Today’s announcement is a true testament to Shriners Hospitals for Children’s commitment to innovative world-class pediatric care. Join us in celebrating being a part of history in the making.    
Yours in the faith

https://plus.google.com/u/0/115810399850545696521/posts/KAxUfAPdVQf?sfc=true

Here's some of what I wrote...

It's been a year of transition and activity.  I resigned from the Enable Community Foundation.  and I retire (today!) from Rochester Institute of Technology.  Skip Meetze and I closed the RIT MAGIC ACT/e-NABLE lab  this month and next month we'll open the Rochester e-NABLE Lab at Vertus High School (and at Re-NABLE.org). 

And yet 2016 has also been productive both locally and globally.  Lacally Skip has made huge progress on the wireless gripper thumb hand (released) and arm (in progress) and we have hopes it can be be simpler more functional robust and attractive than current e-NABLE solutions for trans-humeral trans-radial amputees.  We've done our share of makerfaires and local presentations and mentored a few dozen RIT students a couple  of whom will be working in the new Re-NABLE lab.

Globally I gave presentations on e-NABLE in New York City Washington DC and Washington State Rome Cairo Alexandria Haifa Tel Aviv Dubai.  I also published a couple of whitepaper on Technologies for Empowering Effective Mobs academic papers about e-NABLE.  see https://workflowy.com/s/EiAK.12lFfNhYKs#/?q=2016

All this bodes well for e-NABLE in 2017 and for an emerging ""Connected Humanitarians"" alliance with several other organizations.  (Connected Humanitarianism is e-NABLE generalized: not just 3D printing not just prosthetics.  Volunteers using online collaboration open-source methodologies  and emerging technologies to help underserved populations worldwide.)  Between now and June I expect to be doing relevant work in Dubai India South Africa and elsewhere. see https://workflowy.com/s/EiAK.12lFfNhYKs#/?q=2017

Biggest challenges:  
Diplomacy (relationships between ECF RIT e-NABLE community) and sustainability (funding the lab paying the bills).  

What can the community do to help?
Take initiative take responsibility follow through honor the e-NABLE code of conduct keep doing amazing work keep telling us all about it.

(Telling us about it in a post is not a substitute for filling out Jen's form.  She'll do something great with it as usual.  Here's her invitation post:

Q: What is the coolest thing you can do with your hands?
A: Make hands for kids like me but (who) have no fingers.

When you teach children about all of the different things they can do to help others and encourage them to use their ""free time"" to spend creating beauty in the world - instead of plopping them in front of a tv and video games when they are ""bored"" - you grow a new generation of Makers who learn from a young age... just what kind of amazing things they are actually capable of and how much nicer it is to live in a world where people take the time to help each other.",,,,,,,,

It is no secret that the Wolverine hand received worldwide coverage.
So many great things are falling into place since then with many more cool hands to come.

For starters +Oliver Fueckert sent me a dozen spools of some great Excelfil filament that allows me to contribute so much more and work on future designs at home that I never would have been able to create on my limited resources alone. I was able to send hands to the conference and donate a couple spools to enable members in the process as well. Thank you again Ollie!!! I really cant wait to get into this filament more.

To make things even greater ROBO3D The printer I own just donated me a new second printer to double my production!! I am in near shock. Too cool. This is going to be one busy printer!!

Besides the online and news interviews MICROSOFT reached out to me this week and is sending people to my house this month for a story on myself and eNABLE about people ""doing more"" in their daily lives. Holy crap Microsoft!!! It is part of a new Microsoft Channel Instagram they are launching soon.

And to wrap up this week the owner of my local makerspace called me direct today and wants me to have full access and run the printers full time for eNABLE hands. Plus I will be taking charge and running my own print shop right from their location which will include me running paid classes for 3D printing and FREE public eNABLE classes for learning more about us how to assemble hands and how to help the cause for anyone interested in signing up.

I'm so happy to be part of something so much bigger than myself. Being able to really step up and help even more is a huge honor to me and I do not take it lightly. I love you all.

This hand is 'theme' built as a functional proof of concept/art project by myself and should not in anyway reflect the position values or views of the eNABLE group as a whole.


I want to go into a full disclosure as I feel sadly this could easily be misrepresented simply by the pictures alone
I am in NO WAY setting out to weaponize hands or promote violence in ANY manor. The theme and accessory system is directed to a select group of adult men and women who may appreciate the functionality and color scheme in the hand. The tools are added with full utility and function in mind for daily tasks ONLY and with the sole hope of making life just slightly easier for adults who may live more of a rugged or outdoor lifestyle.


For the accessory system of this hand I took commonly shared and used Picatinny rail mounts and added 3 rails to the existing Raptor design. This is a very versatile system and allows almost limitless design of fitted brackets to be printed.
Spoons cameras toothbrushes markers anything you could design and print a bracket for can be mounted VERY securely in a couple different ways.
A search on Thingiverse for “picatinny” will show a number of creative and useful designs already available.
http://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=picatinny&sa=


One of the most important features I set out to add on this particular hand was the ability to securely mount a utility knife. There has been previous questions posted about the difficulty in cooking and eating with limb differences. Trying to slice a tomato or carrots one handed would of course be a chore and always needing someone to cut your food could be an inconvenience or even a loss of pride to someone trying to maintain independence and self worth.
On top of that camping fishing and many simple daily tasks can be handled much easier with a good utility knife and a free hand (if available).
The knife I chose is a very small Kabar with a picatinny mount built right into the handle. It was a perfect fit is light weight and mounts rock solid with excellent control. It was also only $13 on ebay so very affordable. They have other blade designs as well if someone should choose.
*FUN FACT I used the knife itself to cut all the cable and chord for this build. Putting the usefulness in effect from day one by helping to build the hand itself.


For the remaining mounts I printed a few designs off thingiverse for a flashlight and ended up modifying one to fit then printed it in carbon fiber for strength. Again the mounts fit rock solid and really become part of the hand. That is one beauty of printing you can scale to very tight tolerances when needed.
I left a 3rd rail open for anything someone could dream of. Camera watch face cell phone etc...
I had a great thought about a way to utilize a cell phone easier as we mainly use Velro in all the straps. I picked up a cheap $3 phone case off amazon and stuck a square of soft Velcro on the back. Now when needed or for carry it sticks right onto the palm or forearm very securely. It doesnt come off unless you really pull so its a perfect use of available Velcro strapping underneath.


All in all I think it turned out wonderful and looks great for what I was going for.


The hand itself is printed in ColorFabb Olive drab green thanks to Matt Gordon @ PrintedSolid.com and the light and dark browns were samples donated by our own Jeremy Simon. I think it really came out perfect and I can't thank you guys enough for the colors.

I did paint 3 the small screw nuts at the top of the hand as the silver was too flashy. I may order some black ones though. The rest is all printed however.

I hope you guys like it.
Now I will go back to working on kids hands again  :)

Summary of it would be:

Stephan Heunis: [Capetown South Africa]
- 3dPrinter owner and Inventor user.
- Mechatronic Engineer ( Mechanics Electronics)
- Has a very interesting close circle of potential nearby collaborators from researchers to orthopedists and occupational therapy workers.
- Interested in starting from a very simple design with 1 servo and 1 little analog electronic board. Joining all cables to one platform that would be pulled by 1 motor. Possibly pulling individual strings by backhand based actuation.

Alvaro Rodriguez: [Turin Italy]
- Industrial Engineer (Mechanics Electrical  Electronic Engineering)
- Matlab user (ready to switch to Octave)
- Lives nearby Arduino HQ having contacts with people with high level responsibility in it. Nothing too meaningful but maybe worth exploring in a future.
- Interested in deciding the final objective soon and devising from the beginning a chart of possible ways that could lead us there.

For people with ""readable"" forearm nerves/muscles:
-Interested in researching a multimicrophone/multielectrode myographic system that can triangulate the muscle from which the signal comes.
-Phalanx angle control system through electromechanical blocking of mechanism.

For all others:
- Distance Sensors embedded in fingers so they intelligently approach and grab the object

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AndreasBastian/posts/RM8eTstpzHn,"Cross-linking from R&D:  Fully parametric phalanges for improved finger action on the Raptor Reloaded

I've spent the past month or so building parametrically-driven models of the Raptor Reloaded proximals and distals.  These models can be manipulated by a script to populate a lookup table with every scale value and perfect clearances.  Furthermore entire tables can share different levels of clearance making machine-specific tuning viable.  Overall this should effectively stop problems with snap pins from falling out and should greatly reduce noise problems.  

I see these lookup tables as the next step for Handomatic particularly for support of new hands.  I've done a good bit of testing on the Raptor Reloaded and am now close to have a working parametric model of the Phoenix proximal (not yet the thumb).  The lookup table method could serve accurately-scaled STLs rapidly without turn around time for a server to compile openSCAD.  From a user experience standpoint there would be little difference between a lookup table and a dynamic geometry generator on the backend.  I have some thoughts that I am writing up about how I think this should all fit together.  Will share shortly.  

I'm pretty happy with the motion and clearances across scales when printed on my rep2 but would like feedback about larger scales across other machines.  Please feel free to print out the 200% (we'll see the most pronounced effect at this size) phalanges distals and regular snap pin and experiment.  I haven't separated radial clearances from lateral clearances in the phalanges but it would be straightforward to do if testers observe marked differences between the radial pin fit and the overall joint clearance.  

After building parametrics fro the Phoenix hand I'd like to make the Gripper Box parametric so that specific kit-included screw sizes can be used.

Everything I'm finding says that for PLA I should heat the bet to about 50º Celsius in order to avoid pulling away from the bed and warping of the first 10mm.  

I'm seeing the former on smaller parts and the latter on everything.

All of the information as I don't actually know what matters:

Robo3d R1 (latest version) with sainsmart LCD added

Hatchbox Black 1.75mm PLA

Extrusion rate 85%
Nozzle Temp 200º
Bed temp: 50 or 55º same result

Also using Scotch Blue (actual brand I've heard the name enough) as my first print actually came loose during printing.  Scotch Blue prevented that problem but has not affected the pulling away.  (A test that actually extended past the tape was no more warped than a properly taped test.)",,,,,,,,
https://plus.google.com/u/0/110736851786370579318/posts/X3bJDEkMHMC,"Epoxy For Smoothing & Hardening Snap Pins:

The two problems that vex me the most about snap pins is that they tend to be a bit loose and they're very rough. In fact when you look at them with a magnifying glass they look like tiny gears with teeth (linear striations) running the full length of the pin. In short it's a pretty high friction surface.

You can do a acetone vapor bath to smooth them if they're ABS but there isn't much you can do if they're PLA. You can sand them smooth but since they're already a bit loose to begin with it's pretty easy to sand them so loose that they fall right out of the fingers (don't ask me how I know!).

One thing I experimented with is painting them with epoxy glue from Home Depot ($5.00 for enough epoxy for 1000 pins). I just mixed up a tiny batch on a piece of cardboard and paint the epoxy on a pin with a few bristles from an old paintbrush. When it's first mixed it paints on in a light coat and is thin enough to self level to a nice smooth surface. The best way to do it is to paint 1 side of all the pins and stand them on their side with the epoxy side facing up so the epoxy levels into all of the gaps in the teeth. The epoxy sets fairly quickly so there is just the right amount of time to paint 1 side of each pin. When the first side has set after a few minutes I just flip them over and paint the other sides.

What I like about this is it gives a dramatically smoother surface to the pins and the surface is significantly harder than the PLA so it should wear quite well. I'm curious to try dipping a string in the epoxy and running it through the cable channels to see if this might lower friction and harden the insides of the cable channels as well. I use .5mm Dyneema line so the holes are way oversized anyway.

I'm not sure if this is an especially good idea and it's not for everyone but if you'd like to try smoothing rough pins that are undersized to begin with it's a plausible option. Probably best to print 2 sets of pins so if it doesn't go well you've only lost 15 minutes and 50 cents worth of PLA filament :)

Has anyone else ever tried this?

Basic Idea: I shoved a whippletree load balancer into a tensioner box.

Problems: The whippletree load balancer is great. It gives the hands an adaptive grip so that each finger can adjust to a form fitting position for the object being picked up. However there isn't a lot of room to put it between the tensioner box on our hands and the palm. Also you have to tie the coords just right because the tensioner is behind it.

Goals: The whipple box puts the whippletree behind the tensioner allowing you to assemble it wire up the hand like you normally would then adjust the tension like you normally would.

How it works: Each tensioner pin has it's own little tensioner box. You attach the screws to the backs of the individual boxes then assemble the whole box. Once your hand is wired up you insert your screwdriver/allen wrench through the hole at the back of the box and adjust the screws to tighten the pins. Snap on the cover and you're done.

To do: Rework the chain links to be snap pins so this can be assembled in the real world. Add a guide rail over the thumb pin. Add a snap-on cover for the box.

Once I've finished these last steps I'll print it out and see how it works.

The fitting was filmed and will be broadcast on SRF as part of the Cyabathlon. Michel Fornasier request ECF to build the arm because he wants to mentor Lionel into the world of prosthetic use. 
 
This is a new arm that is based on the ECF Ebe Arm with a redesigned RIT hand. Lionel like most young boys wanted it to look like a robot and ECF is excited to maintain its roots of social support of amputee children while expanding into developing world care.

At first I was stressed because the hand didn't function well but Lionel didn't care. He loved it from the moment he saw it and didn't take it off for hours. Some of his friends came by and they played inside for awhile and than grabbed their bikes for a ride. I was nervous at first but Lionel is an expert rider and has been using an adaptive arm designed by Marcus Brunner a local prosthetist.

He mastered the arm for biking in seconds and showed his real skill. It was inspiring for all of us.

I will meet with him again in two weeks. +Jacquin Buchanan and I are working on a new version of the hand.... more to come.

I couldn't ask for a better team to work with than the group on this project. It takes a lot of coordination to design an arm in the USA print it in Switzerland (by Niklaus Schulz and the team at my3Dworld) and fit it. Additionally we have a long term plan for follow care for Lionel.

All the work has been worth it not only have we made a great kid happy but we are building sustainable methods that will help people in the future. This shows the power of the work that ECF is doing.

I said “I can catch a baseball with my bare hand but if I want to play baseball I’ll do better with an assistive device called a baseball glove.”  

Imagine my surprise when Andrew’s dad said “Andrew made himself an assistive device.”  Then Andrew showed us his amazing fork!  

Next time I saw Andrew I gave him a little surprise.  I had used Tinkercad https://www.tinkercad.com/things/8FhTJmZYqSw to design a 3D printable version of the fork handle that Andrew had created in modeling clay.  Andrew tried the printed device and found it to be satisfactory so we decided to publish it on Thingiverse http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1816581 so that other people with hand differences can give it a try.  

+Melina Brown please offer the design to Ethan and others who may benefit from easier grasping a fork to use with a knife for cutting food.  Of course we welcome feedback and other ideas for applications using Andrew’s clever T-handle shape for grasping.

I am an intern working for the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology (TCAT) at the University of Washington. I have currently been working on combining 3D scans from smartphones with CAD models of devices so that people can integrate the specific topography of a body part with the model of what device they are going to be using. I am trying to make it as automatic as possible and so far the best  solution I've come up with is by using Solidworks Scan to 3D add-in to do most of the work. I used this method in order to get the shape of the top of a person's hand around the knuckles so that we can print out a hand splint for people with rheumatoid arthritis that fits as closely as possible to the hand.

  Has anyone else been working on integrating 3d scans with CAD files to fit topography into the CAD file for printing? If so how have you done it? I'd be very interested to see how people have tried to solve this task.

We were almost done with Sam’s hand but after our last inspection we decided to remake it all over again. The reason for this change was that the wrist area was to narrow.

(Scale x 55)-5cm ex:  1.45 scaled hand x 55 = 79.75 - 5 mm = 74.75 or actual measurement (no padding) 74-75 mm
Here is a list of what we have printed unassigned and ready to ship:
RAPTOR
Right 100% Hand*= 50mm +pad= 55mm
Right 105% Hand= 52-53mm +pad= 57-58mm
Left 110% Hand= 55-56mm +pad= 60-61mm
Left 115% Hand= 58-59mm +pad= 63-64mm
Right 130% Hand=66-67mm +pad= 71-72mm
Left 145% Hand=74-75mm +pad= 79-80mm
(Hand* = measurement across widest part of palm)

Hands that can be ready to ship the week after Thanksgiving:
RAPTOR:
1: Left 100% Hand= 50mm + pad = 55mm
2: Right 100% Hand*= 50mm +pad= 55mm 
     (1 boy 1 girl colors)
2: Right 125% Hand= 63-64mm + pad= 68-69mm (1 boy 1 girl colors)
1: Right 145% Hand=74-75mm +pad= 79-80mm

If the scaling is the same for Cyborg (and I am NOT sure):
CYBORG:
1: Left 100% Hand= 50mm + pad = 55mm
1: Right 110% Hand= 55-56mm +pad= 60-61mm

https://plus.google.com/u/0/115790229936940393119/posts/KTSqvaFAGYj,"From virtual Whipple Box to actual Grip Balance Box.

I've got a functional printed version of what I'm now calling the Grip Balance Box. I loved the name ""Whipple Box"" because it let me say ""whipple"" but the name should describe what the part does not what it's made of.

Pros: 

It works: As you can see from the pictures a hand with a regular tensioner box does not engage all the fingers when picking up my glasses case. The red hand has a grip balance box and the fingers all push on the glasses case.

Raptor Gauntlet compatible: The base is the same size as the tensioner box on the Raptor Reloaded so you can just substitue this and it will work.

Cons:

It's huge: It's as wide as the Raptor Classic's tensioner box as long as the Reloaded's box and taller than both. When I look at it on a gauntlet I feel like missiles should shoot out. I started off shorter but variances in printing required extra spacing tollerances. I think I can squeeze a couple of milimeters off the width but I don't think I can do anything about the height.

It's a pain to wire up: With the regular tensioner box you have to hold the hand at the right angle while tying the knots to get the length of the cords right. Actually you can just put a book under the palm. With this I had to hold the hand and hold the whipple tree in place at the same time while getting the cords right. Also there's only one tensioner so you have to get each individual cord pretty close to the other three finger coords before you can tighten all of them. I started to feel like I had a trick for it by the end but I'll have to practice a few times before I can describe the best way to wire it up.

It's weird: Getting all the parts to fit into the box got tricky. I ended up making the tensioner pin actually sink down into the sliding shoe. This means that once you put the box on the gauntlet and slide it into position the whipple tree mechanism can not be slid out. That can make wiring a bit more tricky since you have to get the wires behind the wheel. You also have to have the retention clip off to put in the screw. I'm hoping those are all the consequences but feedback is welcome.

Issues:

Size: I'm going to see if I can make it a little narrower but that won't have a dramatic affect.

Part durability: I'm a little leery of putting the force of four fingers on one screw. I'm going to see if I can widen the tensioner pin and allow two screws to secure that one pin.

Conclusion:

Tiny interlinking parts do not seem to be strength for 3D printing. I kept having to make parts bigger for strength and to account for variation in printing. In the end I got the parts to work printing them at .2mm with 100%. I'm hoping that's a worst case scenario since I'd suggest printing the inner parts at .1mm and most hands will be bigger than 100%.

Feedback and ideas would be great. Is two screws for the tensioner a good idea? Any ideas for reducing the size? I'm going to do another round of adjustments. After that I should hopefully be able to put the files online and recruit some people to test it.

Your work with utilizing 3D printing to produce low cost solutions in a high tech manner is truly inspiring.  
I live in Green Bay Wisconsin.  My daughter is interested in pursuing a career in biomedical engineering.  She is in the 10th grade and is enrolled in an IB (International Baccalaureate) program.  She is currently working on an independent study presentation about the history and future of prosthetics.  

From reading the various posts it sounds as though the actual prosthetics developed go through several steps not all of which generate a final hand for the end user.  My daughter is wondering if it would be possible to get a functional hand which was not ultimately used.  She would like to incorporate this into her presentation as a functional demonstration of the current technology that is being used.   

I am confidant that featuring your device in her presentation will also help to bring additional attention to your admirable work in helping kids in need.  Thank you in advance for your assistance.",,,,,,,,

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MelinaBrown73/posts/9Aw5Z2BdJwq,"Hi everyone!  Just a few things to cover with all of you:

-New volunteers
-Arm Team
-Hand kits for assembly events
-Current matching team load.

New Volunteers

I would like to welcome all of our new volunteers as part of our community and e-NABLE family. Please take a moment to complete our intake form if you haven't already. Once the intake form is completed  you will receive a welcome email. We must express to everyone how important it is to thoroughly review the information it provides. We receive many emails asking questions that are covered by the welcome email and these emails pull us away from answering questions to which the answers are not readily available.  There are steps outlined to become involved but with that we need to ask everyone to research information and seek answers in the community as well. The last thing we want is for our newest volunteers to feel neglected but we currently don't have the manpower to reach out to each of you individually.  There is an immense amount of work going on behind the scenes to create and improve processes to better allow us to keep up but those take time. 

-Arm Team

We are in desperate need of a dedicated arm team to help pinpoint solutions that will allow for easier production while maintaining quality and function. If you are interested and have the time to devote to this effort please email me at enablematcher@gmail.com with the subject line...Arm Team. We can then work to build a team and decide who can be the team lead in charge of organizing and moving the work ahead at a steady pace. +Skip Meetze +Jeff Erenstone

-Hand Kits

We have a ongoing demand for contributions of unassembled hand kits. These hands are assembled at events and then used to help those who need it most in the more remote areas of the world. This is a way to make a huge impact globally and take what we do to a new level.  We can deliver enough hands at one time to put smiles on hundreds of faces but we need help. Imagine the numbers we would have if every maker could contribute just one kit!

Hands consist of just the printed hand parts in a zip lock bag marked with the size.

-Matching Team load

All of us as a community realize that we have grown at a incredible rate.  This growth has put a strain on the matching teams ability to keep up with demand. We are currently adding several new members and also working on a new system and matching app that will provide more automation to the process BUT all of this takes time. Most do not realize that for now what we do is completely manual each step must be tended to by a member of the team. You can imagine how tedious this can be. We are doing the best we can with very few resources for the time being. All we can do is ask for patience and let each of you k ow how much you are appreciated and valued.  These are growing pains but it will get better. A year ago we had to begin creating documents and processes from scratch. Now we are working to improve yet again. 

Thank you to each and every one of you for your hard work and dedication.  And also thank you for patience during this time of growth and development of infrastructure.

It makes me feel like my small contributions are insignificant so I've become inspired to do more and more for e-NABLE and for myself starting with today in which I spent all day printing these electrically conductive parts for a 175% raptor hand that I'm using for R&D on my Spidey Sensor project.  

These parts (and the tensioner still printing) will form one ""plate"" of a human body capacitor that will sense objects both at a distance and through touch.  A speaker and/or vibration motor will report the sensory signal to the wearer thus making e-NABLE hands ""feel"" something akin to the sense of touch - in some ways better and in some ways worse (but mostly better).  

What I like about this approach is that it is entirely practical using today's available technology and it's simple.  I have prototyped the initial version and it is robust and functional plus also fairly inexpensive and otherwise practical.  To recharge just plug in to USB.  To reprogram to add functionality just attach sensors and/or actuators to the available I/O with female headers for connectors just plug into USB and run the Arduino IDE software.  

Adding the equivalent of an Arduino UNO board to an e-NABLE hand with extra unused I/O turns the hand into a development system that the recipients can program to do whatever they want so in effect this Spidey Sensor addition turns an e-NABLE assistive device into a development platform for the recipient who is or would like to be a Maker.  

I'm going to try to get this thing working by Monday evening so I can demonstrate it in the R&D hangout.  Tune in for a progress report whether I can get all the work done by then or not.  Between now and then I've got CAD to do also some design a bit of Assembly and plenty of programming so back to work I go!",,,,,,,,

I am in the process of fundraising for a 3d printer so that my students can help print prosthetic hands for e-Nable recipients. My school board will only allow me to have my students do this if our organization’s “risk management” thinks your “Safety Guidelines & Release and Waiver of Liability and Hold Harmless Agreement” are adequate to protect us from being sued. 
They would like to know if any e-Nable volunteer or employee has ever been sued from a recipient that has been injured because of the 3d printed prosthetic. They also want to know if there are any other private schools that are currently printing prosthetic hands for recipients. And what has their legal counsel said (if you know)?

I just found out that Washington state requires a license to create a prosthesis. $395 for initial application then $195 a year after that. Are these printed hands considered a ""prosthesis""?
 
The waiver on the website (http://enablingthefuture.org/build-a-hand/safety-guidelines/) only provides protection for Enable not the organization or individual making the device. 

So far our school's legal counsel is wondering if once we create the printed hand do we send it to Enable and then they send it to the recipient? Or does the school send it direct? Because if we send it direct to Enable and they give it to the recipient that would be the preferred way to get involved. Maybe the only way from a release of liability standpoint. 

Any help on all of this would be much appreciated.",,,,,,,,

I work at an elementary school in Memphis TN.  I just heard about e-NABLE and immediately thought it was something that would be very meaningful for both our school and our students.  I just have a couple of questions before presenting a proposal.  I would like for this to be more than a one-time experience for our kids.  We currently do not have a 3D printer but would purchase one for this project.

I have two initial questions but any suggestions or advice from others here would be helpful.  
  
1) How many hands might our children be able to print?  I'm not quite sure how we'll structure our participation but I could see several if not all classrooms raising the money to purchase the materials to print assemble and ship a hand.  Perhaps even individual families or church or civic groups that they belong to might sponsor hands for our children to assemble.

2) What age ranges would be able to assemble the hands?  We will definitely want the children to participate as much as possible for their age group.  Our kids range in age from 3-12 years old.

As you may have seen earlier - the +Enable Community Foundation shared some news with the Community that will change how the Community will need to proceed from here on out: https://goo.gl/bFyGKt

+Jon Schull - founder of e-NABLE and leader of our e-NABLE Community shared his own thoughts on the ECF announcement: https://goo.gl/WDnKDU
As you can see there are some big changes afoot here in the Google+ Community as we grow and expand (rather quickly) and need to re-organize a bit before heading forward with e-NABLE 2.0

Please take a moment to read this as there are some new links and changes for you to look at!

1. If you have already had your test hand approved by either ECF or a mentor in the community -  Please go to the new badging system page and claim your ""TEST HAND APPROVED"" badge by submitting evidence of your device passing and we will approve your badge. The link to that specific badge is here: https://credly.com/claim/101276

To claim your badge:
Step 1. Sign up for a Credly account: https://credly.com/
Step 2: Follow the link to the ""TEST HAND APPROVED"" badge above.
Step 3: Click on ""Claim this badge""
Step 4: Submit your ""proof"" and show a screenshot of an email notification or link to a notice that states your test hand was approved by ECF or another member of the e-NABLE Community in conversation or in the forums etc.
Step 5: Please make sure you submit your email address as well when you submit your proof. There is a space for adding text to your list of proof.

We ask that you also leave your email address when you request your badge so that Jon can include you in his database to show how many approved makers we have and make sure you are included in the development of a matching system potential filament reimbursement and award systems and impact-testing research. 

2. Please visit the updated ""Get Involved"" page on the http://enablingthefuture.org website - HERE: http://enablingthefuture.org/get-involved/

3. Note that there is a new process for submitting Test hands for those that hope to eventually become e-NABLE Chapter members or individual makers who may find themselves asked to create a device for someone in need!
We now have a new section on the forums for submitting test hands via photos and videos. You can find that link here: http://forums.e-nable.me/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=5947

4. Please also note that I have just released the new badging system. You can find them here: https://credly.com/u/enablethefuture - and if you click on ""Claim Now"" you will be able to view the currently available badges and please make sure to check back from time to time as I start adding more. (If you have ideas for badges that you would like to see please let me know!)

5. If you are a recipient or recipient parent/guardian that is seeking a device for your child/yourself or were previously on the Enable Community Foundation's wait list - please visit the Chapters page and see if there is a chapter near you and if not and you require assistance - feel free to ask here in the Google+ group and we have numerous volunteers who are eager to help!

6. There has been discussion from some of our members on potentially creating a ""Virtual Chapter"" or two - in EU and USA and potentially other areas where those that are individual volunteers who seek matches but do not have the ability to create a local Chapter in their area - might create what we would call ""e-NABLE Guild Chapters"" that would be manned by volunteers themselves and then listed on the e-NABLE Chapter's map as an alternative to physical chapters - in case there are recipients who are not near any of our other chapters and need a volunteer to create their device for them. 

Do we have any volunteers who might be interested in creating and being responsible for a few ""Virtual"" e-NABLE Chapter Guilds and man them and respond to recipient requests that may come through there? Please email me at jen.owen.enablevolunteer@gmail.com if you are!

7. I believe that this new chapter of e-NABLE will bring even more opportunity than before for more individual makers to create useful tools for those in need - as we seek to expand beyond simply making hands but also tools for those who suffer from stroke arthritis and other hand challenges create task specific tools and delve into the world of creating assistive tactile tools for the visually impaired and classrooms of children who need them. We are going to need all of you who can participate - to do so!

8. If you were previously an ECF School or University chapter and would like to list yourselves on the Community Chapter's page - please do so! We would love to have you join us! - You can find the link for chapters here: http://enablingthefuture.org/e-nable-community-chapters/

If you have any questions or suggestions - please feel free to tag me +Jon Schull or +Shashi Jain and we will get back to you as soon as we can.

Now...go claim some of those badges and let me see the Enable The Future Badge system light up with awards! :D

About a month ago i got my first e-nable Job to build a RIT arm.  I contacted the family for color choices etc and we were all very excited.

I informed the family of the delay.   I feel terrible for letting this family down and would like to know.

2.  Will i receive support from the community for going ahead with the current model.  
3.  I have heard from people the current arm is warmly received...are the design faults serious?  What are they?
3.  When will the new design be ready.

I am keen to print the arm and send it off with a promise of a better one in the future.  How does this sound?

Thanks in advance.

1.  Are the files on the enable web page the most up to date?
2.  How do i use these measurements to scale the stl files to ensure a good fit using cura? (are they all scaled percentage wise or do i inpit individual measurements to scal parts etc)

The design intent was to make it unobtrusive look like an accessory such as a watch be silent and durable be able to be worn under work gloves and return practical grip strength. It is made from PLA with Ninjaflex tips contact surfaces tendon guide and hinges. The hinges are pretensioned to allow the joints to not wobble about in the home position. The rubber tendon guide attaches to the base of the wrist by Velcro. The tendon is made from 50lb braided line. The rubber tip is similar in density to a real finger tip to allow for dexterity. The prototype works well and only lengths need to be adjusted. Once it has been trialled and improved further I will make it available to download for further trials. My friend was so pleased with it that he wore it out to karaoke! :-)

SO i started printing my first raptor reloaded today.  The first finger tip came out just fine ( yellow PVA).  However the next few attempts have failed and i need some help please. The problem is the extruder appears to put pressure on the finger nail which causes the object to rock back and forward eventually loosening the object sticking to the plate (even with glue) and hence the object breaks loose mid print and fails.

He lost his hand and wrist in a job accident last january and after an amazing coincidence I knew his story... that night I thought: ""I have a 3d printer the knowledge but I never did something like this... so.. why not help?""... 

Pablo is 21 years old student and he haven't wrist so the selection of a hand design was limited only to Team Unlimbited Arm and RIT Arm.

If you've ever gripped a large object in your hand you've probably noticed that your palm does a lot of work. Pick up a glass of water and you'll see what I mean. The palms on e-nable hands do this same work but they do it less well.

There are a few reasons for this. The first is friction the second is shape.

Friction:

On many hands the palms are just the slick backside of velcro. +Peregrine Hawthorn  and +Peter Binkley  have improved upon this with leather; among it's virtues is increased friction. +Andreas Bastian  pioneered the thermoformed palm which I believe to be a big step forward (while noting +Adam Arabian  concerns regarding proprioception). Still even the thermoformed palms are generally just slick low friction PLA. I'm not sure what the coefficient of friction is for printed PLA but I don't think it's terribly good. What to do?

High Friction Alternatives:

1. Plastidip: A thermoformed palm can be painted with plastidip to increase it's coefficient of friction and thus considerably improving gripping ability of large objects. Obviously the thermoformed palms have lots of little holes in them and we don't want plastidip on the part the child will be touching with his sock covered hand. We also don't want to lose the wonderful ventilation that these holes confer. One solution is to press the thermoformed palm into playdough so that the holes are plugged (not too deep or it'll be a bear to get out). Once all those little holes are plugged paint away with the plastidip. Remove from playdough while the plastidip is still wet. Repeat for a second coat. Another option is to put some plastidip in a shallow tray and dip the palm just enough to cover only the surface (this assumes it's one of +Andreas Bastian  marvelous bolt on thermoformed mesh palms which are detachable). Either way we have a high friction palm in the color of our choice (or in the very least the color of our choice within the plastidip pallette).

2. Oogoo: Folks have doubtlessly been relieved that I haven't posted anything regarding oogoo for a full year. Sadly one year was the longest I could between singing the virtues of the stuff. If you don't know what it is a quick search of the forum should yield some posts from last fall explaining: how to bond it to meshes how to generate any mesh you can dream up effortlessly in openSCAD using +Laird Popkin wonderful MeshMaker or how to glue it in place with DAP All Purpose Silicone Adhesive. Basically the idea would be to either adhere it a palm either by encapsulating it mechanically in a mesh or simply glued on with DAP All Purpose Silicone Adhesive. Bingo you now have yourself a high friction palm and the ability to easily hold on to all sorts of things.

3. Ninjaflex/Filaflex: You can print a palm in filaflex. Although this admittedly is bit more tricky +Steve Wood  has shown us that it can be done and that it opens up astonishing possibilities. For example you can decide what shape you want the palm to be. This brings me to my next point.


Palm Shape Alternatives:

There are many shapes and textures that are excellent for holding a wide variety of objects. A smooth flat surface is probably the least useful of these. Granted a thermoformed palm is a big improvement because it is no longer flat after it's formed around the recipients limb. Still it's possible to create a variety of shapes that are wonderfully useful in holding objects on a palm. Changing the shape is even more effective when the raised area is made out of a soft material that conforms to the object being held.

1. Oogoo: Last time I'll mention oogoo this year but if you're going to have a high friction palm why not make it out of something soft that will conform to the shape that you're holding? Your grip will increase exponentially as a result. Print a mold for Oogoo like Andreas Bastion did and play around with the shape you want your palm to be. One cool trick is to create an oogoo foam (linked below) and glue a layer of 1/8th inch thick oogoo ""skin"" over it.

It faithfully recreates the soft conforming grip of our real human palms. Poke the base of you palm where it meets your thumb. See how nice that is? That's a million years of evolution that we can recreate with 25 cents worth of glycerine baking soda vinegar corn starch and type 1 silicone!

2. Ninjaflex Filaflex: In the glorious future all printers will print this stuff with complete ease right out of the box. The possibilities are endless with this marvelous material. For the adventurous I think its worth experimenting with this stuff. +Steve Wood  has posted some excellent guides on how to set up your rig for flawless filaflex prints on this forum. At any rate it's possible to print any palm shape you want and you can control the thickness of the skin and the infill is variable to adjust the amount of ""squishyness"" you want to replicate the durometer of a human palm.

Conclusion: This post is already much longer than I intended it to be so I'll stop there. It's been a long hard year since I've posted anything to this forum and I guess I forgot how to be succint. I've been marveling at all of the wonderful advances you amazing folks have made in the hand designs. I'm thrilled with the thermoformed guantlet with the reverse dovetail; it's 10x stronger than the old way and it looks a treat! Kudos to +Drew Murray  and +Stephen Davies. Another standout for me is the adaptive tensioner box from +Jason Bryant. Also +Skip Meetze marvelous Modular Training Arm. Seeing all these great innovations I couldn't resist tossing some palm design ideas out there for better minds than I to consider.

FACT: The palm is largest surface are of the human grip but the area we've done the least work on. I hope someone out there has some spare time on their hands to play around with it a bit!

   A team (+Dante Varotsis  and +Caitlin McDonnell ) went to Haiti last week.  We have been  developing some concepts based on ideas discussed among +Peter Binkley  +Andreas Bastian  +Jeff Erenstone  +Jon Schull  +Aaron Brown  and I at the AU event in Vegas a few weeks ago.  The idea is to use the print-flat and thermoform concepts under development to make an arm for trans-humeral (above elbow) amputees for situations like Haiti.  
     I have built on the idea presented by +Shashi Jain  and his interns a while back to propose a concept for using inexpensive ($10 at Lowe’s this week) battery-powered screwdriver to drive the arm.  Instead of the lead screw proposed by Shashi and team I’m developing a worm-gear mechanism.  
     As Shashi said it should be easy to replace the AA batteries with rechargeable lithium polymer batteries (now commonly used in quadcopters) and whack off the end of the battery ends of the screwdrivers to save room.  One motor could drive the elbow joint and the other a gripper thumb.  
     Hopefully some clever volunteers can come up with mechanical switches to use some kind of body movement to drive the motors back and forward.   These designs have not been prototyped yet.  I’m trying to get some parts printed from local 3D Hub while visiting the kids in GA :-) I’ll share the stl files soon.

Modular Terminal Device by e-NABLE

The Gripper Thumb Hand is a Voluntary Opening (normally closed) Terminal Device (TD) for a prosthetic arm.   It is printed flat and then thermoformed so that the 4 fingers are fixed in a flexed grip.  The thumb pivots at the proximal end and is flexed under power of an elastic ring in order to contact the first two fingers in a “three-jawed chuck” grip. The grip is opened by a Bowden cable that is pulled by an elbow or shoulder action.  

The Gripper Thumb Hand incorporates a 1/2 inch  (or M12) fine-thread bolt for connection at the wrist of a prosthetic arm.  It can replace the commonly used split hook of a conventional prosthetic arm or it can attach to the experimental Modular Training Arm system being developed by e-NABLE.

+Jason Bryant  +Drew Murray   +Peter Binkley  +Jeremy Simon 
When I joined e-NABLE about a year ago +Alex Thomas +Nicholas Hall  +Bob Roth  and +Skip Meetze 
 were exploring Bowden cables as an alternative to using elastics and whippletrees were being explored as a path to adaptive grip.  Recently the Osprey and Phoenix designs have evolved.  Among their incremental improvements are a hand with no elastics and a hand with an adaptive grip.  Why didn't both hands have no elastics and adaptive grip?  

No elastics and adaptive grip seem to be obvious advantages.  In the earlier work it appears that most if not all of the exploration focused on one element for both extension and retraction of the fingers. Did anyone consider or attempt the following:
Closing the fingers depends on fishing line threaded through tubing or perhaps tubing within tubing which bridges the opening between the bracer and hand. The threads run from a whippletree variation on the rear of the bracer forward through guides in the bracer and into tubing which extends perhaps 20mm into the bracer (for a 100% hand). The guides in the bracer are large enough to accommodate the line but act as a stop to prevent the tubing from being pressed toward the back of the bracer and enable the straightening the fingers.  The (inner) tubing and line then run to the fingertips where the line is tied off.  When the user raises his hand the tubing presses against the tie-off in the fingertips and opens the fingers. 
In other words the retraction of the fingers is conventional Cyborg/Raptor with the addition of a whippletree.  The extension of the fingers is a variation on the Osprey hand.  

Since I don't think in 'stl' files like some of you apparently do I'll pass on pursuing the idea if it has been previously explored and shown not to work.  If you think the idea has merit but choose not to pursue it I'll have a go at altering an existing design to test.",,,,,,,,

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+PeterBinkley5/posts/eAd39QWNf7p,"EXPERIMENTAL Design Feature: Spreading Fingers

I've thought for a while that having four fingers all running the same direction seemed a bit redundant. And while I put a slight deviation on the finger joints of the Raptor it isn't particularly noticeable. I was wondering what would happen with a curved knuckle pin. Would that give the user greater opposition between the thumb and fingers improving adaptability to large objects like a ball or a cup? Or would the fingertips just collide with each other resulting in a hand that doesn't fully close? Or maybe a bit of both?

This prototype is basically an Osprey with one experimental design feature: a curved knuckle block.  Pretty successful for a first run. I started with a photo of my hand fully spread and did a little angular analysis. I decided on 15 degrees of spread between adjacent fingers for a total index-pinky spread of 45 degrees. I went intentionally extreme with the first iteration just to see the idea in action. 

The geometry looks more organic and it may improve thumb-to-finger opposition although I haven't done any grip testing. Strung up with all the fingers cabled equally the fingers collided with each other at full flexion. So I played with different grip patterns (adjusting the length of each cable individually) and had some success with Peregrine's preferred configuration the pinky-leading fan. You can see it in the video footage which will need to be in another post since I can't add both photos and video to this post. It looks pretty cool at least. 

Next I'm probably going to try 10 degrees of interdigital spread for an index-to-pinky total of 30 degrees. If I find a really successful configuration I'll get behind the feature but for now it's purely experimental.

This post is mainly addressed to material scientists.

I am a Masters' student in Estonia. I am working on developing a new material that would be suitable for using in Fusion Deposit Modeling based 3-D printing. The main raw material that I use is Polyamide-12 that is left over from SLS process. Since this material cannot be used in the same process again I am trying to find a good use for it instead it just being discarded. 

Two of the goals of my project are to be more green and to bring FDM printing material price down. I would love to give it a try to develop a high-performance polymeric material that is suitable for 3-D printing prosthetic limbs. I read that e-NABLE mainly uses UHMWPE as the main material; does a material developed from recycled Polyamide-12 powder sound realistic to use for prostheses in your opinion? If yes then would you be willing to spare me some of your time and knowledge to advice me on which specific characteristics you are looking from a prosthesis' material are there any improvements you are looking forward to etc?

I would like to co-operate with e-NABLE. I see that the main cost on producing those limbs is the material since the rest is based on voluntary work. It would be great if that cost could also be brought down and even more people in need would have an access to prosthetic limbs.

Please let me know what you think of my idea. And feel free to ask me any questions.

When I close the hands I've made the fingertips close much later than the the knuckle joints. It feels like there's a huge amount of resistance as the elastic cord runs over the tip of the proximal joint. It feels like the elastic is caught at that point and doesn't move at all until the first joint is almost maxed out.

What if there were a round pin at the end of the proximal joint? It wouldn't even need to be a snap pin the sides would be enclosed in the figertips even when the finger is closed so a simple cylinder wouldn't slip out. I think the 100% hand has enough room for a small but reasonable pin. Plus it would have plenty of support from both sides to keep the part solid.

The disadvantage is that you can't adjust each wire. You have to get them about right from the start. However there will be four knots for four fingers instead of eight plus you don't have to get them completely perfect because there's still an overall tensioner in the back.

The big advantage is space. My original whipplebox design kept getting bigger as I tried to make the parts big enough. This one has the same base as the Raptor Reloaded box so it can simply be swapped out.

It doesn't even have too many parts. The standard tensioner box has six part a box and five pins. This will have eight once I add a box cap and I think assembly should be pretty obvious. Here's the layout.

On the bottom is the tree base. It has three poles and a snap pin built in.

On that you put two wheels and a swiveling tensioner pin. The tensioner pin has a rail on the bottom which fits a groove in the box. That will keep the whole thing in line.

One top of that is the snap-on tree cap.

That's not too hard right? The wire from the first finger goes around a wheel and down to the second finger. Ditto for the third and fourth finger. The thumb gets a standard tensioner pin. You screw in that pin and the tree pin to get the wires to the right tightness.

So that's version 2. I'll try printing it out this afternoon. I love the suggestions that the first whipplebox generated so feel free to add to this point.",,,,,,,,
https://plus.google.com/u/0/+SkipMeetze/posts/8xyKYyG75gk,"Jason Bryant recently posted an interesting tensioner design where a Steve Wood 3-element whippletree is attached to tensioner pins with a screws and the tendons are tied to the pins in the standard way.  Then the assembly is covered in a tidy arrangement.  

This got me thinking about adapting the singletree type of whippletree https://www.youmagine.com/designs/adaptive-grip-mechanism-for-prosthetic-hand which is simpler to assemble and seems to have some extra adaptive benefits from the tendons going around pegs that act as pulleys.  

If this tensioner works as I hope it will it could deal with my concern that some 3-jointed digits result in the wrist being hyper-flexed to fully flex the fingers.  With this device  the user can increase the tension to flex the fingers at anytime by pulling on the little handle and decrease the tension to extend the fingers by pushing on the handle.  

The user can maintain a comfortable wrist position while gripping a bicycle handlebar for instance.  

I may not get to test the design for a couple of weeks so I would appreciate it if someone would print it out and give me some feedback.  Maybe we can do a video hangout if you run into problems or if you have something good to show.

Up to this point it has mainly been with some standard Raptor Cyborg beast and Flexihand 2 designs but we are now at the point where more and more requests are coming in from recipients with little to no wrist movement and arms. And in some cases we are finding it quite hard to determine whether a modified hand design will work or whether an arm would be necessary.

The photos show the hand of a girl looking for the correct device. She has some (but slight) movement in her wrist and pretty much no residual palm. But I am hesitant to go for an arm immediately also taking into account the many awesome designs that our volunteers have created for similar situations. Could we get some advice from volunteers who have previously helped recipients with similar cases? I know some of you have printed solutions and it would be great if you already have some feedback from the recipients on how your designs perform.

My blog is called Wisdom of the Hands.

Methodology: I started by printing some PLA ""sticks."" They're long boxes made about the same width and thickness of the bottom rail of a Raptor gauntlet at 100%. I dipped the sticks in boiling water for varying amounts of time. Then I placed them between two chairs with a bucket hanging from them. I slowly filled the bucket with water. When the sticks broke I recorded how much water was used. Since 1 ml = 1 gram This was an easy way to roughly measure the weight needed to break a stick. My measurements weren't terribly exact but they made a decent approximation for a first test.

Results: Boiling seems to weaken the parts not strengthen them. My measurements were not as accurate as I'd like but it's hard to look at the results and believe that another test would give better results.

However I'd still like another test if someone else is up to it. Perhaps someone with an accurate scale unlike me. Science isn't really science until someone can replicate your results.

Breaking Weights:
PLA normal - 6.55kg
PLA 10 sec in boiling water - 6.5kg
PLA 20 sec in boiling water - 6.1kg

Stick dimensions:
4.5x100x6mm

Print settings:
35% infill
.20mm
2 shells

Process:
The ends of the stick are placed on two separate surfaces spanning them like a bridge. A bucket is hung on the middle of the stick. Water is added to the bucket until the stick breaks. Then the water is weighed.

Note:
The last time I did this test I placed the plastic stick between two chairs. Halfway through it I realized that if a chair moved even a little bit then there would be a different gap between the supports changing the leverage changing the results. To avoid that I made a fixed arch to put the sticks on. This way there is the same amount of space and leverage every time making the tests more uniform.

Note about the note: I love the fact that I needed a specialized arch for testing and I could just design one and print it out. 3D printers are neat.",,,,,,,,

Here's a video of Peregrine introducing his latest build:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtojLN_BHts&feature=youtu.be

Large gauge nylon monofilament is amazing stuff. Because it pushes as well as pulls you don't need elastics. Also because it's thick and smooth it doesn't ""saw"" through the ventral channels of the proximals. For a 3-year-old child (print scale 90%-110%) I'd consider 1.0-1.2mm 100-150-pound line to be ideal. 2.0mm 400-pound line is about the maximum for an adult and that would be for a very large man hand of 160-170% print scale. 

I've been able to identify three sources of nylon monofilament and I have acquired examples of each.

Low-memory deep-sea fishing line is available in  all relevant sizes in 0.2mm increments up to 2.4mm! I've found an eBay merchant who sells 100 yard coils for 10-17 dollars each plus five bucks shipping. I just got a bunch (and combined shipping) so I'll probably use a lot of it from now on.

You can also use landscapers' trimmer line which is available at hardware stores and gas station convenience stores all over the US and Canada. 0.065"" diameter is good for an adult build and 0.050"" is good for a small child 100-115% print scale. Trimmer line is what I have mostly used in the hands I've built.

Nylon 3d printing filament is available in 1.75mm at Taulman3d which would work well in a 120-160% print scale build. I'd suggest Bridge Nylon for lower scales since it is softer and less resistant to bending (lower memory) and nylon 615 for larger scales since it is more rigid and offers more robust extension of heavier fingertips. I don't have any nylon 645 so I can't comment on its properties yet. 

Peregrine is using the 2.0mm fishing mono here in his 158% scale Talon. I think it's overkill but he's happy as a clam.

This is still very early but here are some details on my progress with the powered standard Raptor (printed at 100%).

I printed a very basic bracket for a single RC servo (http://netram.co.za/1699-servo-medium.html) that can be fixed to the gauntlet. Then I also printed a small fitting that fixes the servo shaft to the outer side of the palm without having to make to many changes to the standard palm. I made the palm and gauntlet holes slightly larger so that the printed part could fit nicely and then I made a sunken slot into which the rectangular part could fit. (I think the photos and video explain the concept better than my words do).

As you can see from the video the servo does not provide enough torque for the hand to close (it's rated at about 3kg.cm at 5V) which is why I have to help every time I give the instruction to close. This means either two servos should be used if I keep the servos in the same configuration or I have to find an alternative to servos i.e. small geared dc motors. I'm inclined to go for the second option because of two reasons:
1. these servos are very finicky and not a very neat solution IMO. The problem is finding smaller motors with higher torque ratings at the same price. Any ideas?
2. Having two servos back to back would necessitate more space which means a larger palm and gauntlet which means the powered option would only be valid for teenage or adult recipients and not for children. This is not ideal.

Another thing that I want to do for the next iteration is to move the servos and bracket to the palm side. Not sure why I didn't think of this in the first place. More suggestions are welcome.",,,,,,,,

One volunteer’s opinion by Skip Meetze

Our arm designs are not ready for the average volunteer to use.

This opinion is based on my decades of experience as a Human Factors Engineer in the development of consumer products (not including any medical products) and a 7-months experience as an e-NABLE volunteer.  Please consider it as a starting place for discussion.

In my opinion we should establish some guidelines for what prosthetic devices and under what circumstances our volunteers should feel comfortable in providing the particular devices to recipients.  We should include our whole R&D community in the discussions   Otherwise there will continue to be a diversity of opinions and misunderstandings about the appropriateness of various arm designs for any individual volunteer and recipient.  

Of course our volunteers are free to do whatever they want to do with the various designs that are published within our community and elsewhere.  

Unlike the wrist-driven hands however there is a risk and complexity to the fitting of a prosthetic arm to an individual that needs a lot of research before we have designs that are as safe for most volunteers to undertake.  

In my opinion our arm designs are still very much in the realm of research and development and their use should always involve people (such as prosthetists and medical professionals) who are trained and qualified to take a risk on behalf of the the recipient.

Grip strength is really important. The grip strength of existing hands needs to be improved but that's difficult to do if there isn't a way to even measure what the grip strength is!  Here is one approach.

A cheap spring scale is used to measure the input force. A cheap food scale is placed in the palm and the fingers are closed on it with a fixed force exerted against the tendon lines (which are attached to the spring scale) to measure how much grip strength is produced given that fixed input force.

I'm going to put the scale in the palm of a v1 Raptor hand and take a measurement using 10lb of input force using my grip efficacy testing rig a full description of which can be found here:

Here is the $12.00 food scale that I bought:
http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-Scale-Chrome-1kg-Digital/dp/B004O76DLU/ref=sr_1_11?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1422035344&sr=1-11

Here is the $12.00 spring scale I'll use to measure input force:
http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-AMW-SR-5-Digital-HanGinG/dp/B003SWZWNC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422296464&sr=8-1&keywords=11lb+scale+american+weigh+scale

I envision measuring just the 4 fingers with the first measurement and then the thumb-forefinger pinch grip with the second measurement. Since I don't actually have a hand with a thumb or a 3d printer the pinch grip measurement will take a while! :)

Ideally it will be possible to measure the grip strength throughout the range of motion of the grip. I'd like to measure it with the fingers fully opened 25% closed 50% closed 75% closed and 100% closed.

I have a half baked idea of how to design a rotating holder for the scale so that I can measure the finger force at different rates of closure but it will take me ages to get to that project. I'll stick to just measuring gripping force with the fingers fully closed by just placing the scale in the palm.

My main objective is just to get folks thinking about cheap reliable ways to measure grip strength so that we can assess whether we're making progress on this critical metric of hand utility. If you've got another idea of how to do this or can find a better scale be sure to post.

Thoughts?

https://plus.google.com/u/0/106984577182142381313/posts/FweGixWpa4W,"Hi all. So i've been thinking of a way to incorporate powered options into our standard designs but by making as little as possible changes to the designs. This is so that volunteers familiar with the standard Raptor Cyborg beast or Flexihand can easily work with a powered option as well and to ensure that powered options stay in the loop with future iterations to the standard designs. With that in mind refer to my pictures below (sorry if the quality is bad I should just get a new phone and get it over with). Currently I have thought of two options:

Option 1: Fix one or two servos (number depending on torque rating and requirement) to the gauntlet. The bodies will be stationary with regards to the gauntlet while the palm should be fixed to the servo shafts. This way when the servo shafts turn the palm will rotate and the fingers will close. This basically replaces a person's wrist action directly.Just brackets to attach the servos to the gauntlet and the shafts to the palm will be needed - small changes.

Option 2: Translate the circular motion of the servo shaft into a linear motion of the tensioner by connecting the two via a cable and winding this cable onto the servo shaft. The wires then pulls the whole tensioner bracket with all the strings towards the arm thereby causing the fingers to close. For this to work the connection between the palm and the gauntlet (currently pivoting) will have to be fixed. A bracket for the servo/s a rotary-to-linear translation system (sounds more complicated than it is) and fixed connections will be necessary - a few more changes than option 1 but still not much.

Im leaning towards option1 because of the following:
- direct drive solution no degrees of freedom in between the shaft and the actual movement.
- less design changes

But this is just the way I think. I would like and appreciate some input on this before i go ahead with the next phase. Please feel free to join the effort if you are intrigued. +Monika Jones +Nick Parker +Roberto Baccarini +Mike Trieu +Ed Greig +more people :)

I am wondering if we can collect some information about how well hands hold up in real life and what the long term perception of users might be.  

I have two persisting questions:
1.  Do users continue to use their hands after the ""shine"" has worn off and if not why and
2.  Do they break and if so how and how do they get them fixed?

This is an important feedback loop to make sure we are providing the best hands we can.  Do we have relevant hashtags?  Would it be possible to encourage closing contact after some duration of use - perhaps a month or two?

I feel like until we get a solid number of hands out and feedback back from them that they ARE being used and AREN'T breaking we are just guessing on our design.",,,,,,,,

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LairdPopkin/posts/6xYWLLXNmVi,"3DHubs is a network of people doing paid 3d print jobs. As such they have a print quality challenge similar to what we have in that when we match up a fabricator we'd like to know that they can produce quality hands. 3DHubs has a process for verifying a new printer's print quality by sending a specific test print and having the person perform the print and submit a photograph for review which they require before listing people as being available for print jobs. And they have training material to help improve people's print quality.

There's been some discussion of a 'test hand' which is certainly a good way to start. Perhaps we could take that idea and make it formal and before matching people have people print and assemble a test hand and submit a photograph for quality assessment? That's cheaper and easier for all involved than sending the actual hands. Of course we'd need a team to review the photos for quality assessment and to provide feedback to fabricators.

It also strikes me that if we run the process ""in public"" (e.g. in forum posts) then we could generate tons of good examples of various print quality with associated discussions of techniques for improving prints which would be valuable for fabricators particularly ones new to 3d printing.

Of course there's a tradeoff between a formal process like this and number of fabricators so we might end up with fewer fabricators on the map but they'd more more validated.

Here is some feedback from my recipient when he first saw the hand he said  "" Oh WOW!""
This also a good example of an oversized device which was produced using the measurements from the photo using the #tracker program. Maybe use the photocopy flat-bed scanner and other discussed methods of getting a more one to one scale to gain measurements remotely and enable a bit fit. I was more worried that it was not going to fit when in fact it was too large for his affected hand.

The tracker software stated that the R8 distance was 70.55mm on the non affected hand but was actually 66.35mm and 62.65mm for the affected hand.

I'm also going to put four fingers upon the new printed palm as he was unable to do a ""pinch"" with his index finger. He also  had problems trying  to get fingers to bend upon the first join (the one nearest the palm) the force required to bend the palm was quite high but that could be due over-tight elastic and it being too large for him.

The experience was positive and he went away with the device to learn the method of operating the hand; He is going to come back next Thursday to try the smaller printed hand which I will produce before then together with pouch to hold in the hand  giving him full use of his thumb.

Since +Nicholas Hall did his post about Oogroo made with the DAP Silicone Adhesive I have been doing my tests with different silicone-adhesives and cornstarch. 

The best one by far is the result of using an adhesive silicone named Sikaflex. I searched online and it looks like this is sold worldwide. I hope so.

Unlike oogroo their properties are very similar to those of the commercial sugru:
- It is very moldeable.
- You can mould it for 30 minutes. No hurries.
- It cures in 24/48h.
- It sticks like hell to almost anything.
- Stays like that forever*.

*: If you do oogroo with enough cornstarch to make it moldeable (like sugru) it will dry and get weak in 1 month. This does not happen with Sikagru. The cups from the photo have 2 months and we use them everyday. The material properties didn't change at all after the first day.

I have done tests on several materials and it sticks until the point that if you want to take it out it breaks before. So it's pretty adhesive.

I have done tests to a flat surface of ABS as well (sorry no photos) and it sticks pretty well. Much much better than regular Oogroo. But here with enough strength you can take it out without breaking it. Anyway I think it's good enough (probably just like commercial sugru).

Here in Europe sikaflex costs 5€ per bottle. That's twice the price of regular silicone but still pretty affordable.

+Nicholas Hall if you find the time I would love you to put this on the kind of stress tests you were doing to your other oogroo innovations to see what are the real improvements in adhesiveness.

I have done tests with 1:1 ratio (in weight!). Sikaflex is pretty sticky so you need a lot of cornstarch (1:1 in weight is a lot more of cornstarch than sikaflex in volume :) )

If you reduce the amount of cornstarch you will end up having to wait a lot to mould it (1-2 hours!) or never been able to.
If you increase the amount of cornstarch you won't be able to mix it. Actually with the 1:1 you have to finish the mix with your hands until it becomes like plasticine.

I started by printing some ABS ""sticks."" They're long boxes made about the same width and thickness of the bottom rail of a Raptor gauntlet at 100%. I dipped the sticks in boiling water for varying amounts of time. Then I placed them between two chairs with a bucket hanging from them. I slowly filled the bucket with water. When the sticks broke I recorded how much water was used. Since 1 ml = 1 gram This was an easy way to roughly measure the weight needed to break a stick. My measurements weren't terribly exact but they made a decent approximation for a first test.

I found that they all broke at about the same weight. There seemed to be a little progress at one point but one of the chairs holding the sticks also moved a little. This had changed the leverage on the stick. I tried to correct it and the next stick broke at the same weight. Either way the variance was too small to be significant.

Stick dimensions:
4.5x100x6mm

Print settings:
35% infill
.20mm
2 shells

Process:
The ends of the stick are placed on two separate surfaces spanning them like a bridge. A bucket is hung on the middle of the stick. Water is added to the bucket until the stick breaks.

Note:
There was one issue in boiling the sticks. At 35% infill ABS floats. I had to use a kitchen utensil and a paperclip to lightly hold them under the water.

Breaking Weights:
ABS normal - 5kg
ABS 5 sec in boiling water - 5kg
ABS 10 sec in boiling water - 5kg
ABS 20 sec in boiling water - 5.35kg
ABS 30 sec in boiling water - 5.3kg
ABS 20 sec in boiling water - 5kg

I tried this in ABS because that's what my printer is currently loaded with. I'm going to switch to PLA in a few days after some other projects and try again. It may be that water just doesn't boil hot enough to do much for ABS. Perhaps I should try boiling them in oil.

Any thoughts on my process or suggestions for changes in the PLA tests?

For now I have changed the proximal phalange just a wee bit to allow the use of flexible filament for the ""tendons"". I am using Taulman PTFE a nylon coplymer that is remarkably flexible yet does not stretch. This so far does three things: vastly simplifies assembly; eliminates the need for elastics as it can both push and pull with the ability to return to position as the wrist is straightened; allows for a more complete overlapping closure of thumb and fingers for better gripping characteristics.
Nylon can be tough to print but this latest from Taulman does OK when used with glue stick and brim. It also incorporates all of the other useful characteristics of nylon: easily dyed any color can be anti-microbial infused; has a soft touch feel to the material and a natural lubricity that allows for a smooth non-greasy operation.

The clip in the back worked awesomely well.

+Skip Meetze 's 'flat' gauntlet was very easy to print and to thermoform. I just put the gauntlet on a plate added a little water and microwaved it. After 30 seconds the PLA was starting to be soft and at 1 minute it was very soft but hot too hot to handle - I reached in picked the plastic up and bent in into shape. I kept the ""ribs"" parallel by putting them flat on the kitchen counter and they came out level and square. Once it cools and hardens which takes only a few seconds you can stick the part you need softer back in the water which I did with the ""arches"" and after 10 seconds or so it's soft enough that you can adjust things. All done with bare hands and no boiling water. And not only is the flat gauntlet extremely easy to print it's very strong. I printed it at 100% fill since it's so thin that hollow wouldn't save material - and I wanted to make sure that the thick parts stayed stiff even though the thin parts were soft. The flat gauntlet is thinner than the ""standing up"" one and it's more compact with no support so it prints very quickly.

So all in call be a happy camper. The community's designers continue to amaze and delight!

I'm wondering if anyone has ever printed a gauntlet that they couldn't crush in their hand.

The gauntlet's I've printed in the past have always seemed pretty weak. I saw one last weekend that didn't even survive the shipment to a recipient. The maker had mailed it along with the hand via UPS Next Day Air (at his own expense!) at a cost of $50. It was in several pieces when it arrived.

Since I had a spare gauntlet in my basement I decided to do a crush test to see how strong my own gauntlets were. I printed it on a makerbot 5th gen with 4 shells 30% infill in PLA.

There's some yellow silicone oogoo foam glued to it but that did nothing to impair it's strength if anything it probably strengthened it as evidenced by the fact that it broke on the opposite side. I also painted one side with resin intended for fiberglass to see how this affected durability. It helped but not enough.

Watch the video to see how weak this thing was.

Now I know these gauntlets are not designed to resist crushing in this way. I also know there are about 100 variables that go into like slicer settings nozzle temp etc. My intent is not to solicit advice on any of these parameters.

I'm wondering if anyone has ever printed a gauntlet that they can't easily crush in their hand. Can ABS gauntlets be crushed this easily? Has anyone ever perfected their settings to print PLA that can't be easily crushed in their hand? Maybe I really am just printing these totally wrong.

 +Skip Meetze doesn't count. He showed me a thermoform gauntlet made from his ""PLA Plywood"" last weekend that was dipped in boiling water and formed over a forearm.

For a given and constant range of motion theta the height of the cable exit channels from the palm ra and the length of the palm rb which can be used to describe action arc lengths arc_a and arc_b which relate theta to the deflection of the fingers.  I'm still working out the exact mathematical relationship between ra and rb but intuitively and in practice rb seems to have a positive relationship with finger deflection.  I think it's directly related to the length of the arc described by the proximal joint-- when this is longer this translates to more deflection of the fingers.  I'll have to sit down this weekend and maybe try summing moments to get a more precise relationship.  

That being said I'd also like to verify any model with a robust explanation for why the short palm didn't close as far too.

It was printed with 2 shells 35% fill 0.20mm layer height and roughly 100mm/sec speed 220F with PLA.   I made the supports in NX so I only used a raft to attach to the printer bed no tape or other goop direct to the acrylic bed on one of my MakerBot Replicator 2s.

The second example is a 130% scale vertically only same settings.  I had a print error at the last couple of percent so ignore the error at the top where the wrist hinge goes.  I seem to get these errors from time to time where a ""glitch in the SD card has been found"" or something like that.  Probalby a MakerBot flaw.

This stencil was designed to simplify the process of making the bracer portion of any hand requiring leather. All you do is give it the circumference of the arm on either end of the bracer and the distance between the two measurements and the Thingiverse Customizer spits out an STL that can be printed into a stencil for cutting out a simple bracer shape.

This makes the hardest part of making a leather bracer as easy as putting string up to a ruler. I hope we can simplify the leatherworking process further to make it more accessible. Of everything I've tried leather is the most comfortable and most effective thing I've tried and I'd like to see more people using it.

It's also worth pointing out that this tool could also be used to aid you in making just normal not prosthetic bracers for a costume or something.

I think that it's effectively a difference in lever arm length and consequently the length of the arc described by the motion of the flexion of the wrist that causes this difference:  shorter palm shorter lever arm shorter arc of action shorter deflection of the fingers poorer functionality.  

I also found that the exit angle of the elastics from the proximal phalanges is very important.   On the thumb the elastic is forced to exit the proximal  joint at a tangent the most mechanically efficient direction for the restraining force.  However on the other four fingers the elastics exit at a slight angle off-tangent and consequently the elastics have a harder time restraining the motion of the fingers.  

Finally I realize that I hadn't mentioned this before but I've been making gauntlets with one strip of velcro anchored on one side and threaded through the other so that it can be tightened effectively and with only on hand.  It requires a little hot-glue or stitch-work to make the velcro sides engage properly but I think it's an improvement on the ""two-flap"" option.

In the past I've talked a great deal about how much potential gripping force the black finger return elastics consume. I've speculated that they might waste as much as 50% of the total potential gripping force that a small child with low wrist strength can generate.

Since I now have my trusty grip efficacy testing rig assembled I thought it might be helpful to stop speculating and put some real numbers to this.

My methodology for testing this is pretty simple. I rigged up the hand so that all of the finger tensioning cables were attached to a single zip tie. I then attached a highly accurate scale to the zip tie and measure the force required to close the fingers on a normally configured v1 Raptor. This gives me a measurement of the force necessary to close the fingers with the elastics in place.

Note: I was very careful to configure the elastics so that they were pre-tensioned the absolute minimum amount required to open the fingers. I spent about 90 minutes doing this so it's as close to minimum elastic force as I can get. I'm guessing the average assembler doesn't put this much time or thought into elastic tension so it stands to reason that an average hand is actually much worse than the results below.

To test the force required to close the fingers without the elastics I just snipped the elastics off with a pair of wire cutters and removed them with some needle nose pliers.

I took a video of both test so folks could see for themselves.

Results:

4 Finger Hand With Elastics: Peak force = 2.2 lbs
4 Finger Hand Without Elastics: Peak force = 0.18 lbs

So there you have it. The 4 elastics consume about 2lbs of force. Note that my hand only has 4 fingers (no thumb). My best guess is that the thumb elastic also consumes about .5lbs of pull force like the other fingers. If that's the case my estimate for a 5 fingered hand is as follows:

5 Finger Hand With Elastics: Peak force = 2.7 lbs (estimated)
5 Finger Hand Without Elastics: Peak force = 0.23 lbs (estimated)

Assuming a small child with weak wrists is only capable of generating 5lbs of wrist flexion a five fingered hand with elastics would consume 2.5lbs or roughly half his total potential gripping force.

It's an easy experiment to reproduce with a $12.00 scale from Amazon.com This is the scale I used:

http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-AMW-SR-5-Digital-HanGinG/dp/B003SWZWNC/ref=pd_sim_k_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0YVBCC2MMNEEEBDAFNK8

At any rate my point is that the little black elastics that we use consume a surprising amount of potential grip force. This is especially relevant in the case of small children with minimal wrist strength (which incidentally is the majority of the recipients!)

I'm curious to hear if anyone has ideas on how we might improve this.

Also I'd love to see other folks give measurements of different hands like the Cyborg Beast Flexy Hand 2 Ody Hand or Talon. It's just $12.00 to find out how your own hand performs on this test!

This is the shiftable one-way device I'm working on that could facilitate ""ratcheting"" fingers so that grip could be sustained without continuous effort or an accessory drive for things like screwdrivers or a jar lid opening gadget etc. where the wearer repeatedly flexes the elbow or wrist and the tool advances like a ratchet. This uses Sprag clutches which have almost zero backlash and can be turned in tiny increments. In a ratchet you need to advance the mechanism past the pawl in order for it to advance. 

I just printed and built this concept model assembly and it works as expected (there's a small error in my animation but the concept is proven in the printed asssembly). The Sprag units are available online for $5 and for $5 I'm happy with the quality. The specific drill apex holder may prove more difficult to source. The outside diameter needs to be 10 mm.

I'll be working to turn this into a component that could be incorporated into a gauntlet hinge or a wrist portion for an RIT arm. I'm thinking this would require a pull-pull configuration as the strings would have to be relatively tight around the driving spool.

When printed in PLA the thermoforming is easy because hot water in a tray gets the part up to glass transition temperature.  It can even be formed around the recipients arm with a towel between the skin and the hot part.

When printed in ABS it is trickier because an oven must be used and the part remains in the rubbery state for only a few seconds when exposed to room temperature.  Try setting it on a block of wood on a tray and watch for the wings to droop.  Then take the tray from the oven and form the curves with gloved hands.

The criss-crossed layers maintain their plywood properties after being thermoformed so that the part is very strong like molded plywood boat hulls.

Ok I have printed alot of hands for LittleCoolHandLuke and as I sit putting these together I inevitably think of changes that could be made. But my CAD skills are severely lacking. Anyone out there who wants a shot at helping out here's your chance.

First up is simple. In the photo you will notice elastics and how I have attached them. First challenge is to design a way of replacing the screws with either pins or a bar with pins that allows you to tie the elastics to the pin then insert the bar into the existing holes. Said pins or bars can be glued if desired. Or we could drill holes in the palm right where the elastics come thru the phalanges as a tie off point. If that is structurally possible. 

Now on to the more difficult challenge. A year ago I printed a hand and mounted a ""guitar-tuner"" like tensioner on it. That tensioner worked great but I was told it was not structurally stable now. The current design works but it is still hard for me and I'm sure others to tie the little strings and still get the tension right. So my next challenge is a tensioner redesign.  I was thinking of built in worm gears for each finger. That would eliminate the need for screws too.

These are only suggestions for change. Please don't beat me up suggesting these. But please share your ideas and any changes you might like to see. Thanks! ",,,,,,,,

I made a variable density test print in Filaflex of the scanned residual hand with a ""solid"" core inner printed at 50% infill to replicate some bone structure. then the outer was printed with a loose 10% infill to represent the soft tissue of the skin and muscles. The result is fantastic and feels superbly realistic it is hard to show in pictures or even a video but this has convinced me to follow this avenue for further testing. Maybe the Flexy-Hand fingers will have an internal ""bone"" mesh.

The print was a bit challenging with the extruder ""machine gunning"" between the mesh gaps so I will re-design the mesh to only have a single vertical oval slit in the middle.

Here are two pictures of my recipient's hands that were taken about 4 days apart. The first set from the initial intake document was a bit blurry so I had the recipient take another set of pictures.

I used the tracker software on both photos as per the instructions at the time (2 months ago). Now we just take the 1 measurement and not 20 as we did earlier. In any event I was blown away by how big the differences were in measurements. The issue wasn't the initial scaling of the ruler in the Tracker software. I checked it a dozen times on both files. My best guess is that the issue was the angle that the photos were taken at and the fact that lenses are round. There are probably other things that I don't understand that caused the difference.

Take a look at the first two photos for comparison. If you look at the measurements from wrist to the tip of the index finger one photo says that the distance is 154.8mm and the other one says 127.8mm. That's a difference of nearly 2cm and 20%. Look at the distance between the wrist and the first proximal phalange joint one photo says 70mm and the other says 80mm. Again that's a difference of a full centimeter.

Take a look at the thumb of the affected hand. In the intake photo that he took (blurry photo) it looks like there is barely a thumb. In the second picture it's obvious he has nearly a full thumb.

These are enormous differences. I guess the big question then is ""which photo was the correct measurements that lead to a good fitting Raptor hand?"" The answer is that both photos lead to terrible fits. I went with the larger measurements from the clearer second photo and I still wound up with a hand that was way too small. I had to increase the length of the palm by a full 20mm to get a decent fit.

The final irony is that this is these are the hands that you see when you go to the Handomatic where it instructs you on how to take measurements! Take a look at photos 3 and 4. Picture 3 is the handomatic measurement page and picture 4 is the photo from my recipient that the photo was taken from. It's the same picture and the same hands from the same young man in the first two pictures with the wildly different tracker measurements! I was the one who did this hand and I failed terribly.

I guess my point is a picture is worth a 1000 words but that doesn't mean it isn't completely wrong. If this has happened to you and you're looking for a better way here are a couple of ideas.

Template Check Method from +James Holmes-Siedle :
https://plus.google.com/117596495829636702960/posts/c9JHTxrmM4k

Flatbed Scanner Method another great idea from +Steve Wood: https://plus.google.com/110736851786370579318/posts/2258XdTtBf2

I think that the flatbed scanner method takes a much better picture. There is no distortion from round lenses or bad angles. Printing out a paper ruler and scanning it along with the hand gives a way to confirm that the photo is perfectly scaled when printed by checking an actual physical ruler. If you look closely at the mm marks on the steel ruler it's matching up perfectly with the ruler on the printed page. The scanner on a $30 home document printer works well for this purpose.  A photocopier works too.

As +Bob Roth pointed out the best possible solution is to get a mold of the hand. Alginate provides exceptional resolution. A guide to using it has already been made. The cost of the kit is $12 for the alginate $10.00 for the plaster and probably another $10 in shipping. The cost of the mold will exceed the cost of the hand which is an obvious problem but it will provide a great fitting model.

http://enablingthefuture.org/resources/creating-a-hand-casting/

A lower cost albeit lower resolution method is the ""packing tape ghost"" model from +James Holmes-Siedle. The user wraps their affected hand in many layers of packing tape and mails the ""mold"" in a simple letter envelope. This keeps the cost below $2.00 and yields an acceptable resolution for our purposes.

I saw some posts about 3 phalanx fingers and I want to share my vision on the subject as I am currently experimenting with it.

The model I am working on will be a derivative of the Raptor. As one might see I used the differential components designed by Steve Wood in the rendered model (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:392970) which works great by the way. 

Well I made the complete model and I noticed a compromise had to be made between tension in the fingers and a reasonable amount of force exerted to make the hand grasp. Replacing all the metal parts with wooden plugs was not the answer and neither was minimizing friction induced by the tendons. I think a properly functioning 3 or even 4 phalanx finger can work if the tendons are attached in a more human way. This must be vague for some but that is what is basically done in a lot of mechanical hands these days with levers instead of chord.

Anyway I will look after it because the model below works quiet good  and human like aside from the massive amount of force required to make it function as intended...

Thanks a lot for your time and this wonderful initiative e-NABLE.

Those almost snowboard buckle like parts are used to quickly change the tension. In that way I was able to change from a pincer grasp to a fist easily.",,,,,,,,

I created this primarily for the ""Thumbless"" Flexy-Hand 2 due to the difficulty of incorporating the recipient's  thumb into a velcro pocket and not loosing too much efficiency.

It is not ideal having to use screws to keep the mesh attached and agreed they are a pain to screw in if like this example in the pictures you attach the mesh to Flexy-Hand with thumbs (it's all I had). But it will work using small sharp self tapping screws and I like to keep the tabs folded down inside the palm area for aesthetics. However if you find it easier you could screw them to the outside of the hand more functional if a little uglier.

There is a narrow and wide wrist option and all the info is on Thingiverse : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:380665

Thought I would share these photos with the community. I sent a failed palm print to my recipient. As I was wondering if it was going to fit; looks like it's going to be a bit tight on the left side near the thumb and the index finger.

I'm going to reply to my recipient asking them to add a ruler to the photos and ensure that everything is 90 degrees to each edge. So I'm able to measure the photo using the tracker. As the widest point is not across the knuckle; my original measurement. It's about 2-3 up from that between first and second holes of that set of 3 on the left hand side.

The file  was made by the hand-o-matic with a 5mm thinkness for padding which if you look at the photos has worked on the right hand side and the front but not on the left due to enlarged index finger.
Will measuring the widest point to point enable the print to be larger and fit the enlarged index finger?
Could I use the original measurement and just increase the padding size to get the correct fit?

I saw +Steve Wood  amazing work with insoles recently and I was delighted by his use of a simple flat bed scanner to scan feet. It occurred to me ""why the hell aren't we doing that for hands?"". It takes a dramatically more accurate photo and the scaling is perfect and the printed image's scaling can be confirmed with a ruler.

The photo measurement method that we use today is riddled with issues that caus poor fits.

One of the problems with taking a picture of hands is that the pictures must be taken exactly perpendicular to the hands to minimize the measurement error. If a picture is taken at an angle the hand that's further away looks smaller. Worse yet the lens is round which introduces it's own variable distortions at different points of the photo. It all adds up and the sum is a poor fit.

Things get even worse when we take a sophisticated measurement tool like tracker and measure a distorted photo that's a bit blurry and taken at the wrong angle. We imagine that we're getting measurements right down to the mm because the software says so. The rule of all software applies however garbage in garbage out.

This might be a better way. Take a scan of the hand with a flatbed scanner! To validate that the image is captured and printed perfectly to scale a ruler from http://printable-ruler.net/ is printed out and laid on the scanner when the scan of the hand is taken. This way when the maker prints out the scan he can lay his own ruler against the printed image to confirm that the mm or inch marks line up perfectly. The image should be scanned as a pdf and should be printed with scaling = to 100%.

A second scan of the wrist with the palm perpendicular to the wrist is helpful because the wrist tends to lift off the scanner bed when the palm is down against the scanner bed.

On top of that you actually get a hand you can print out and put inside the 3d printed raptor before you send it. This will identify all kinds of fit issues.

If you're building a hand and you think that the regular photos are just fine I encourage you to have your recipient take a scan of his hand like the ones I posted above and then remeasure with the tracker software. I'm guessing you'll be surprised by how far off you were going to be... :)

I'd love to have some folks try this out and check it against the photos they would have used. Let me know you're results!

Plaster of Paris is a great molding material for casting recipients hands. The trouble is it's pretty fragile stuff. When it comes to molding delicate features like fingers it's not terribly sturdy. If you're going to be thermolding plastic over the mold it's not a bad idea to reinforce it.

Fortunately I happened to have some lovely chopped PVA fiber left over from some experiments making bendable concrete. It's awesome stuff. Using this fiber in conjunction with a plasticizer I was able to make remarkably impact resistant bendable concrete boards. It occurred to me that this would be just the stuff for keeping delicate plaster-of-paris fingers in one piece. It stood to reason the stuff would work on plaster-of-paris as well. Here's the stuff I bought:

http://www.concretecountertopsupply.com/index.php?app=ecom&ns=prodshow&ref=PVA5

To find out if it worked I decided to cast up 5 plaster of paris biscuits in plastic cups with varying amounts of the PVA chopped fiber. For each of the biscuits I used the following recipe:

2 tbsp Plaster of Paris
1 tbsp Water.

Then I added varying amounts of PVA fiber:

Biscuit 0: No PVA
Bisuite 1: 1 tsp PVA
Biscuit 2: 2 tsp PVA
Biscuit 3: 3 tsp PVA
Biscuit 4: 4 tsp PVA

I mixed up each of the batches which took about 5 minutes and then I left them to fully cure for 48hrs. Each of the pucks was about 1/4"" thick or so which is roughly the thickness of a tiny finger.

Then I cobbled together a testing rig using a half dozen woodworking clamps 2 small sticks of wood from my scrap pile a long nail and a 16oz plastic hammer. I didn't want to spend more than an hour or so on the project so the testing rig isn't exactly pretty. But it worked!

Results:

The PVA made an enormous difference. Biscuit 0 which had no PVA exploded like a clay pigeon on the first impact. Biscuit 1 which had just 1 tsp of PVA cracked but didn't break. Biscuit 2 with 2 tsp of PVA had a hairline crack only. Biscuit 3 didn't have any damage at all after the first hit with the hammer. In fact it took about 8 hits with the hammer before a hairline crack formed.

The first video shows biscuit 0 exploding. The second video is of biscuit 1 sustaining little damage after 1 hit. The third video is biscuit 3 being wacked over and over again with no apparent damage.

Depending on how fine the features need to be I think the right mix is probably between 1 to 2 tsp of PVA to 2tbsp of Plaster of Paris. The PVA fibers do make the plaster harder to mix and pour. One tsp is barely noticeable but two tsp becomes a bit lumpy. Three tsp is really too much to capture fine detail and is no longer self leveling.

This may not be terribly helpful to folks who don't have PVA fibers lying around but I think any chopped fiber like chopped fiberglass will greatly increase the resiliency of your molded hands/fingers. Given that it takes 48hrs to fully cure plaster of paris this could be a time saver if it prevents a mold from breaking.

I sent about 1lb of this stuff to +Jeff Erenstone   who'll be testing it out on an othrotic press. I'll be really curious to see the results!

Here's a bit of late night psuedo-science for anyone interested in Oogoo foam.

One of the things that I was curious about was whether or not I actually managed to balance the Ph of the oogoo foam I created by adding baking soda and vinegar to my regular oogoo mix. Doing this created a cool foam that could conceivably be used in lieu of foam padding or in sockets or some other fun application.

The concern with all oogoo from a skin safety standpoint is that although the silicone is food-safe it creates acetic acid (vinegar) during the curing reaction which could be a skin irritant. I wanted to see if my oogoo foam was still slightly acidic. So like any normal person I decided to set up a modest lab to test it. Mind you I think I got a C in chemistry 15 years ago or so and that's my sole qualification for this experiment.

To start I got the most sensitive Ph testing kit available off the shelf in my small town. I bought it for $5.00 at Petco pet store. It's intended use is for testing the Ph of water in aquarium tanks. The nice thing about it is that it tests between 6.0 and 7.8 which is a pretty tight range around neutral ph of 7.

Next I went looking for distilled water without luck so I settled for Poland Spring water. The poland spring water tested at a Ph of 6.6 which based on an internet search is quite plausible. My Tap water tested at around 6.8 but god knows what else is in it so I stuck with the Poland Spring water.

Next I tested how sensitive the test was to a base by using less than a gram of baking soda mixed into the 5ml of Poland Spring water in the test tube. Just a gram was enough to raise the Ph from 6.6 to 7.8 pretty decisively. I deemed this sensitive enough for my purposes.

Next I took a block of oogoo about 0.75""x2.5"" and put it on my cutting board. Then I minced it up like garlic and hoped to god my wife wouldn't come into the kitchen catching me in the act. Fortunately the book she was reading was quite good and she didn't see any of this. :)

When it was nicely minced I poured 10ml of water into a clean glass cup and added the minced oogoo foam and then stirred it rigorously with a chopstick for about 5 minutes to leach out any acetic acid from the oogoo into the water.

Next I poured the slurry into a coffee filter and dripped the water back into my test tube. I then performed the Ph test per the package instructions and was very surprised by the results.

Not only is the Oogoo foam not acidic it's actually slightly basic. It raised the Ph of the Poland Spring water from 6.6 to 7.8. That's about the same Ph as many other spring waters right out of the bottle (google it).

I wouldn't suggest that based on this test alone that oogoo foam is skin safe. But one thing is for sure it sure as heck isn't acidic :)

When +Skip Meetze +Jon Schull  and I visited +Jeff Erenstone  prosthetic workshop in beautiful Lake Placid NY Skip brought along something he called ""PLA Plywoood"". It's printed flat on a printer bed dipped in boiling water and then formed over the recipients forearm. It's simple to do and it's remarkably strong and flexible. My best guess is that it's 5x to 10x stronger than a traditionally printed gauntlet.

The difference between +Andreas Bastian  thermoform mesh and Skip's ""PLA Plywood"" is that Skip's material is a flat sheet with no holes and Andrea's thermoform mesh is well a mesh with lots of holes in it. The objective of this post is not to compare the merits of the thermoform mesh which is wonderful vs the PLA Plywood but rather to call attention to an interesting innovation (PLA Plywood) which folks might not have seen.

I'd love to give more details on how the PLA Plywood was printed and why it works but it's not my story to tell. I'll let Skip finish his experiments and post his printing methods heating methods and results. I will mention that it was originally intended that the PLA Ply be dipped in boiling water to heat it similar to thermoform mesh.

Where things got really exciting is when Jeff put the PLA Ply in the oven to try to remelt it in order to form it over a plaster mold of a local recipients hand. Jeff put the gauntlet in the oven at 375 degrees in order to see how well it would take the tight compound curves of a hand mold. 

We intended to do it for about 5 minutes but we forgot it was in there and it totally melted. We almost threw it in the trash but we decided to try peeling it up and using it anyway.The result was something incredible.

Jeff formed the melted PLA over a plaster mold of a hand from a local recipient. It took the tight radius compound curves with ease. It stayed pliable for several minutes as Jeff formed it over the mold. When it cooled the strength was simply unbelievable. It was just 1/6"" thick but I could barely bend it let alone break it using both hands. It was easily 10x stronger than any PLA part I've ever printed. It was actually stronger than the thermoset carbon fiber that Jeff had also used on the same hand for the same purpose.

I think that there are a lot of applications for this stuff. It could be entirely possible to build an entire hand and gauntlet using this method. The resultant hand would be stronger lighter and cheaper than anything we have previously built. Here are some of it's virtues:

1. Prints in 1/3rd the time
2. Uses 1/2 as much material
3. Is 50% cheaper to print
4. Is dramatically stronger
5. Molded over a plaster mold yields a perfect fit.

Unfortunately in my excitement over this stuff I only took 1 picture of it. I did however take several photo's of the plaster mold and the carbon fiber part we were trying to compare it to.

I'd love to get this material properly tested by someone like +Mark Deadrick  so we can get some real strength data on this stuff!

The oogoo that I typically make has a durometer of about 20-30. Since I was already playing with baking soda to neutralize the Ph I was curious to see if it would be possible to trap a ton of air bubbles in the oogoo to make it into a foam.

To do this I decided to add in a tablespoon of vinegar and a tablespoon of baking soda into my standard oogoo mix. Everyone who has ever been to a science fair knows that mixing vinegar and baking soda makes for tons of bubbles as the vinegar and baking soda combine to make water and Carbon Dioxide.

It worked and it was an absolute ton of fun to do.

When it cured the oogoo just about doubled in size and has half the density of traditional oogoo. It retains the same great elasticity. It has a similar squishyness as a kitchen sponge! The vinegar smell was totally gone after 24hrs of curing so I think it may be Ph neutral as well.This stuff is really cool it's food safe it's fun to make and it's cheap as dirt. Take a look at the pics of the oogoo next to it's altoid tin mold. It puffed up just like baked bread :)

Maybe a more refined version has applications as a socket material or as foam padding?

At any rate I thought it was kind of neat so I thought I'd post it on here for posterity in the event that any does a search for ""Oogoo"" at some future date :)

I was inspired by +Melina Brown who was interested recently in a space filler for a partial foot in a shoe. +Steve Wood thought of oogoo and that got me thinking... :)

One of the things I've been curious about is whether or not it's possible to neutralize the acetic acid (vinegar) that is the byproduct of type 1 silicone when it cures. Oogoo gives off a strong vinegar smell while it cures and the scent though faint persists for many days even after it's cured. Although the acetic acid is very weak the smell is annoying and it could be a skin irritant.

My solution was to mix baking soda in with the cornstarch. Baking soda is a weak base and that vinegar is a weak acid. When you mix them you get Carbon Dioxide and Water. Since the silicone is water curing in theory you should get a ph balanced oogoo that cures even faster with a neutral ph and a slightly lower durometer from trapped carbon dioxide bubbles.

I think it worked!

I haven't figured out a way to test the Ph yet but the vinegar smell is totally gone after just 24hrs! I added a ton of baking soda though so the oogoo is a bit gritty and too soft. Still I think I neutralized the Ph while keeping the whole mix food safe which might come in handy.",,,,,,,,

I'm trying to use 3D printed springs combined with pin joints to form the finger mechanism. With this design I thought I could get away with gluing the springs in place but it hasn't worked out well at all.
Another issue is the mechanism that pulls on the tendons moves through an arc that doesn't actually pull the tendons that much so I'll need to work on that too.

Actual cost to have the hand printed was 100 euros so not going to challenge fdm printers soon on price but there is arguably less post processing required. The detail level is also pretty good.

The idea is a plastic 3D printed plastic that is custom shaped to the users then reinforced with thermoset resin that can be modified (carved sanded etc).   This is a lamination of two materials and gains the positive characteristics of both.   Bondo may not be the best material but is worked well in this ""proof of concept""

Here is a short video showing how the Raptor 1.0 fingers seem to get stuck at 90 degrees.

You can see that the force input starts at .25lbs and slowly climbs to .5lbs right up until the distal phalange becomes perpendicular to the proximal phalange. At this point the force input on the scale spikes up over 1lb to break 90 degrees and the finger suddenly lurches forward the force drops back to .5lbs or so and then slowly climbs up to 2lbs to fully close the finger.

Other folks like +Eric Griffin  and +Thierry Oquidam have described this sticking point so it's not just this one hand. I thought it might be useful to videotape this happening and measure it with a scale.

This raises a few points:

1. We should tweak the fingers/cable routing to remove this sticking point in the fingers. The fingers should close smoothly.

2. It takes way too much force to fully close the fingers tightly against the palm. 2lbs is way to much force to close 1 finger. This is partially due to Hookes law and the lengthening of the elastic but part of it is the cable routing and finger design. One thing worth pointing out is that the issue isn't insufficient attention to elastic tying. I spent 3 hours tweaking the elastic lengths to prestretch it the absolute minimum amount required to return the fingers to the open position. The fingers barely have enough elastic tension to open fully. If you've never spent 3hrs tweaking the elastic length with a spring scale accurate to 10 grams it's likely that your own fingers require substantially more force to close!

3. It would be great to have tension adjustment for the elastics. If I had a choice between tension adjustment for the closing cables (which we currently do with the Owen Tensioner) or tension adjustment for the elastics I'd pick tension adjustment for the elastics. The Meetze adaptive grip mechanism somewhat addresses finger closing-cable length adjustment but there is nothing that addresses elastic tension adjustment. It matters a lot!

I think we can safely say that +Andreas Bastian and +Laird Popkin have already done a years worth of work 3d modeling in the past month alone. Who else has some solid modeling skills and is interested in working on this?

This builds on the direct drive palm idea that I posted yesterday. There is a push plate mounted on the underside of the palm which is connected to a plate on the surface of the palm via printed pistons. The cylinders can slide up through the palm when the user pushes on it.

When the human palm pushes against the push plate the bumps rise up to meet the fingers and the thumb is pushed up to meet the index finger and the distal phalange is rotated forward via a control cable affixed to the palm.

The thumb in this position could have enormous power. The thumb is added to the plate to create either a cylinder grip or pinch grip. It's a lot more efficient to actuate the thumb directly rather than routing cables with 180 degrees of bending to actuate off of the gauntlet.

This idea isn't even half baked I really just wanted to show +Skip Meetze  and other interested folks what a push plate in the palm might be used for.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AndreasBastian/posts/NogMjZHYNxG,"Announcing Raptor 2.0 Beta Fusion 360 Edition!  This is a parametric solid body iteration on the Raptor hand that can easily be downloaded as IPT STEP IGES STL or OBJ files.  Additionally the entire design has been documented in detailed 2D drawings specifying all important interfacing dimensions.  This iteration of the Raptor is designed to lower the barrier to collaboration and contribution-- with models in a parametric and easily adaptable format it will be much easier to try new ideas.  The 2D drawings serve as a ""hardware API"" that describe how to design geometry to interface with the Raptor 2.0 fit scheme which is itself derived from the Cyborg Beast fit scheme.  

The Raptor design team has been steadily testing for the past several weeks but now we're ready to beta test in the community!  We would love to get more feedback on this design so please print assemble and test!  After the incorporation of community feedback we can launch Raptor 2.0!

Changes/Improvements:
-Cyborg Beast-compatible fitting (wrist width and maximum palm width)
-Narrower knuckle-block and wrist for better fit
-More accessible cable routing
-Easier elastics tie-off
-Removable knuckle pins for easy maintenance/repairs
-Improved retainer clip for dovetail tensioner
-Custom-modeled supports for both palm and gauntlet for better interior surface finish and velcro-slots
-Additional lateral velcro mounting options for the palm
-More ""head room"" in the palm (less of an aggressive taper to the knuckles)
-Tensioner pins have thicker walls and bigger holes for threading the flexsors

Know issues:
-The cabling between the palm and the gauntlet is offset by a few millimeters
-The wrist spacing on the palm is 51mm instead of the intended 50mm.  This gives a little extra clearance between the gauntlet and the palm and is not detrimental to function but will be taken to 50mm for consistency's sake.

Files can be found here for now but will be moving to a more permanent location later this week: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/clnglxhexhlk5mu/AAAFLJE297GKWmuaIgXQ1vsva?dl=0

A final note:  if you are planning on modifying the files in Fusion please hold on for a little while longer.  I am doing one more from-scratch restructuring of the palm and gauntlet to make them more robust to parameter changes near the beginning of their structural trees.  STEP/IGES mods should be fine in the meantime.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/110736851786370579318/posts/DPtLShQCsw8,"Direct Drive Palm: Half Baked Idea of the Day

In an ordinary human palm there is a fourth joint at the base of the palm as pointed out by +ELIZABETH JACKSON in a recent post. This is a fairly weak joint in a normal human hand as pointed out by +Nick Parker. For our e-nable hands however this is actually the spot on the hand were we have the most potential power.

The reason for this is that this is the only point on the hand where we have a 1:1 leverage ratio. In the fingers a great deal of power is lost to leverage and the leverage ratio might be more like 1:10. If you put 1Kg of force in wrist flexion you get about 100grams in finger grip; most of the loss is to leverage. However when you push the human palm against a plate on Raptor palm if you put 1kg of force from the palm against the plate you get 1Kg of force against the plate (1:1). In other words the power in the palm could be 1000% higher than in the fingers (rough guess not measured results).

One way to capture this would be to put a flat PLA palm plate that screwed to the face of the palm. Two large bumps sit on the palm plate and can travel in and out of it on PLA pistons. When the palm is pushed against a push plate on the inside of the palm the two hemispherical bumps rise up to meet the fingers.

This accomplishes 2 things:

1. The distance that the fingers need to travel to close is reduced. This is important because the amount of force that the fingers are able to generate is a direct function of the ratio string travel finger movement. Lower the finger travel while keeping the wrist flexion constant and you increase grip power.
2. You get a 1:1 force involved in gripping. This could make for a pretty powerful grip.

The pictures attached are very crude and exaggerated. I had about 20 minutes free and this was what I was able to do in Sketchup. The oogoo coated palm hemispheres wouldn't travel as much as pictured; I just wanted it to be clear that they were moving.

This idea was inspired by +ELIZABETH JACKSON  and +Gregg Dennison recent posts rethinking palms (Elizabeth) and leverage (Greg). The direct drive palm is pretty tangential to their ideas which frankly are a lot more interesting and a lot better developed but their posts are what got me thinking about this :)

At any rate it's a half baked idea but I think it's an intriguing one. What do folks think could this be made to work? Would it even be useful?

My name is Brian Kaminski and I'm the founder and owner of Advancer Technologies. I recently became aware that the e-NABLE community uses a lot of our muscle sensors in their amazing projects. I have a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering (biomechanics) and a M.S. in Mechanical Engineering and at one time aspired to be a prosthestician.

I originally started my company after I designed and built an EMG sensor for a robotic therapy glove/orthosis that was a continuation of my senior design work. I had become extremely frustrated during my senior design project that there were't any off the shelf EMG sensors for students and hobbyist to use in their projects so I thought I could help others out and started selling my sensor. Surprisingly what I had initially thought as a way to generate some small amount of pocket cash to try to offset the costs my own hobby/projects has become a growing business and has allowed me to continue improving the sensor design drive the cost down and make fun and exciting tutorials to help cultivate and motivate the next great minds into the field. 

Anyways I just wanted to let the community know that your work is very close to my heart and I would like to get more involved in any way I can.

Please feel free to email me if you would like to use our sensors in your projects; I am more than happy to make our sensor available to the e-NABLE community for at-cost pricing.

Also don't hesitate to email or contact me if you need my expertise or advice on how to add muscle sensors to your project.

Thanks so much for all your great work so far and I'm excited to see what the future brings.

Looking at the approaches to getting grip on a finger/palm I suddenly thought of this idea.

Why not use the squishable nature of the flex filaments and push them into a groove - so I tried it and it works really well.

Would probably be even better with a lower shore flex as ninjaflex is 80+

Printed best on its back - but you just print a 3mm hole that is cut to leave just enough room to push in the flex to hold it!

Black elastics aren't a great solution for finger opening. For smaller children or children with weak wrists I suspect they consume 25%-50% of the potential grip strength when the fingers are all the way closed. This is because of Hooke's law which says that the longer you stretch a spring (or elastic) the more force it takes.

The exception to Hooke's law is the constant force spring. These ingenious little devices maintain a constant force no matter how long you stretch them.

I've been thinking it would be great to mount one of them inside the palm to serve a single return elastic for the fingers (1 spring for 4 fingers). You would route dyneema fishing line through the fingers and tie all 4 off to the constant force spring cable. This way you'd have the same amount of resistance no matter how much you closed the fingers.

I just found a great little spring that costs about 50 cents each and comes premade in it's own housing. I just bought a 5 pack at Staples (they were charging $2.00 each though). It's just a retractable ID badge! It's a great little constant force spring though. I think it has enough pull to do all 4 fingers. The spring housing is quite small ~1"" diameter and 1/4"" thick but it can handle 36"" of travel which is overkill since we only need 2"" but it has the same pull whether you do 1"" 2"" or 36"".

It would be mounted directly underneath the cable block at the back of the hand. Right now this is just dead space. There's plenty of room to superglue the housing here. It also wouldn't be visible because it would be inside the palm cavity (a hole would be drilled for the string to come out).

It's a pretty cheap easy way to get past Hooke's law. No matter how far you close the fingers the elastic has exactly the same resistance.

I am working for a 3D printing company in Latvia and we are currnetly trying to print a prosthetic hand for a boy with agenesis. As you can see in this photo he has a ""thumb"" so we had to really ""zoom out"" the 3D file for the thumb to fit in. As a result the hand (currently we are working with flexi hand 2) is enormous and uncomfortable to use. Maybe you have an advice how to.. redesign the file so that there would be more space for the thumb but at the same time it would me smaller?

Thank you very much for any advice :) We are new at this so any insight and expierince will be useful!

Looking at the Raptor and Cyborg Beast one thing really stands out to me. The control cable for the thumb has to take a 90 degree bend. This generates an enormous amount of friction. It seems like a $0.25-$0.50 sealed bearing would solve the problem nicely and could be installed in 10 seconds or so with a single screw.

The thumb should be the strongest finger in the hand because it's used in opposition to the other 4 fingers in gripping. Currently it's probably the weakest because so much of it's strength is currently lost to friction taking that nasty 90 degree bend.

A $2.00 skateboard bearing is probably way over-engineered for the task. It's designed to take loads orders of magnitude higher than what a thumb would need in much wetter harsher conditions than the hand would experience. I would guess we could get a pretty good bearing for around 50 cents. Even just a 1 cent steel collar that rotates around a screw would be 10x better than what we're currently doing I think.

I saw some nice looking grooved bearings on ebay that are about the right size for 28 cents each. It seemed like a good deal but I don't know much about bearings.

Has anyone ever tried using a bearing mounted by a screw or a steel collar mounted by a screw on the thumb? Is it a good idea or a waste of time and money?

I'm guessing if it was a good idea we'd already be doing it given how little it costs and how easy it would be to install. What are the downsides?

- Roughly 30 durometer (just about perfect!)
- Silicone is clear/transparent and can be tinted any color
- Adheres directly to plastic (no mesh no cotton intermediary)
- Available over the counter (Home Depot)
- $1.50 per ounce
- Standard 2.8oz package size (enough for 5 fingers & palm)
-  Type 1 Silicone (acetoxy)

I'm pretty pleased with this stuff. I didn't think it would be possible but by golly it's stuck like superglue!

The mix is as follows

1oz DAP All-Purpose Adhesive Sealant 100% Silicone
2 tsp corn starch
8 drops black artist acrylic
 
The fingertip looks like something the cat dragged in but I didn't use a mold I just spread it on with a plastic spoon. It could look like a million bucks if you used the incredible fingertip mold that +Andreas Bastian created.

I got the idea while I was dreaming up a rig using a reciprocating saw with the blade connected to the tension cables of a Raptor hand to perform repetitive opening and closing. I'm curious to see how long it takes before the hand falls apart :)

I can buy a Harbor Freight reciprocating saw that will do the job for about $25. It has variable speeds from 0 Strokes Per Minute (SPM) to 2500 SPM. I was thinking the lower end of the range would be advisable. At 2500 strokes per minute I think the hand would probably  explode.

Before it explodes though I was thinking that the hand would get pretty darn hot. Maybe hot enough to melt the PLA in the spots with the worst friction.

That's when it hit me. You could run the simulation at about 60 SPM for a few minutes and the hand would do just fine but the spots where the friction was the worst would start to heat up. If you could take a picture of that with thermal imaging you'd be able to see where the worst friction was just as plain as day. You could compare chicago screws to snap pins. You could compare .5mm dyneema fishing line to nylon shade cord.

The only trouble is I don't have a thermal imaging camera and I'm pretty sure I don't know anyone who does. Does anybody have thoughts on how I might get access to one? For example what sort of job might require having such a tool in one's toolbox? Maybe I can track someone down who is likely to have one that I can borrow for overnight.

A better question is if anyone has done this with our hands? An even better question is ""is this just a dumb idea to begin with?""

It's very likely that this problem is restricted to just my Raptor but I thought I'd post the issue just in case anyone else has had the same problem.

I was playing around with a Raptor configured in the normally closed configuration and I noticed that there is too much play in joints such that the back of distal phalange can actually rub up against the front of the proximal phalange. Take a look at the first pic with points A and B labeled to see what I mean.

Granted I'm using chicago screws in lieu of the snap pins so sizing is likely an issue but I have this problem even when I use the snap pins. It makes for a whole lot of friction and jerky finger movements.

This same issue occurs in the knuckle joints. You can see in the second picture where the top of the knuckle joint is actually shiny from rubbing against the inside of the knuckle joint in the palm.

Again this could just be due to poorly fitting chicago screws or overzealous sanding but I wanted to flag the issue to see if anyone else was having the same problem.

Has anyone else had fingers with this much play in the joints? You know you've got a problem if Point A shown in the first pic can touch point B. There should be at least 1/16"" gap here even under load.

Which gripping pattern is the most useful? It's an interesting question especially if you're limited to just 1 or 2 grip patterns on an e-nable hand. I've been scouring old journal articles to see what research has been done to classify grip pattern usage frequency in daily life.

One of the best articles that I've come across is ""Sollerman Hand Function Test"" by Christer Sollerman and Arvid Ejeskar published in the Scandanavian Journal of Reconstructive Surgery.

Here is a screenshot of the article where it lists 8 grip patterns and the relative frequency of use of each based on their research. +Adam Arabian posted some interesting points regarding grip patterns and I thought he and others might be interested to see what Sollerman's research showed. Since +Skip Meetze has figured out how to do a multi-position thumb I thought he might be interested as well.

I just tested my 3rd test plate and I was blown away by how well the oogoo was stuck to the plate. It turns out that allowing the oogoo to fully cure over the course of 24hrs makes a huge difference with regards to the strength of the mechanical bond. I think the bond strength is getting very close to 50psi.

When I tried prying it up from 1 corner to pry the oogoo off the plate I actually wound up tearing the 1/4""thick oogoo skin. That takes a lot of force. The original test plate that I pulled up was disappointing but it had only been curing for 2hrs or so. Giving the oogoo enough time to fully cure made a big difference.

I'm guessing that the tear strength to pull the oogoo skin off of the 1""x1"" plate is somewhere around 50psi. I'm not strong enough to pull it off. 50 psi is pretty darn good as a starting point!

I think that it's possible to double the strength of the mechanical bond  by changing the mesh. Fortunately Laird anticipated that I'd ask for the wrong thing the first time around. So instead of just sending me a flat STL of the mesh he actually wrote an OpenSCAD program that generates any custom mesh you want. The man is a genius.

For starters you can change the dimensions of the mesh plate to any length or width you want. You can also customize the diameter of the tubes the spacing of the tubes and the number of layers. It's pretty incredible. I had never used OpenSCAD before in my life and I was a little intimidated to try it since I'm such a 3d noob. It took just 60 seconds to download and Laird's program was so intuitive that I was able to generate exactly the mesh that I wanted in 5 minutes. If you're interested at all in experimenting with an oogoo bonding mesh I strongly encourage you to try it out.

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:518257

The next mesh I'm going to try will have wider spacing between rows so that the oogoo ""tubes"" are much wider relative to the plastic bars. This should greatly improve it's ability to resist being torn up from the corners. I'm also going to change my oogoo mix to include more cornstarch. This will increase the durometer and reduce it's elasticity. It appears that the bond failure occurs when the small diameter oogoo tubes stretch past their tear point elongation of about 350%. I think lowering the oogoo's elasticity will make a difference.

My hope is to get the bond up somewhere around 100psi. That should be good enough for government work :)

Here are the links to my next 2 test plate meshes on thingiverse if anyone wants to try printing them out and testing the bonding with Oogoo. I expect the thicker tube version to have a bond somewhere around 100psi or more.  +Adam Arabian +Skip Meetze 

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:525162/#files

The fine mesh pictured is only about 2mm thick which is pretty low profile. It should be possible to print this mesh on any surface area where oogoo sugru or any other soft RTV elastomer is wanted. It could be applied to fingertips the proximal phalanges the palms for gripping or elsewhere on the hand for padding or impact resistance.

I finally figured out a way to glue oogoo to plastic. I learned early on that oogoo bonds to cotton t-shirt fabric amazingly well; the oogoo tears before the bond fails.

It stood to reason that if I could glue a swatch of cotton t-shirt fabric to a Raptor finger I could then glue the oogoo to the cotton. Suffice to say it worked. In fact it worked so well that I can't get the stuff off at all and now I have to print a new Raptor finger.

The first step was to cut a round swatch of cotton t-shirt fabric about 1"" in diameter. Then I spread an extremely light coat of ""Amazing Goop"" all purpose adhesive on the raptor fingertip (thanks +Skip Meetze for recommending this stuff). Then I stuck my little cotton swatch on the wet glue on the fingertip and conformed it around the curves. While the glue was setting I spent about 2 minutes mixing up a batch of my regular oogoo mix. Then I just spread the oogoo on the cotton that was glued to the fingertips.

That's it.

It's nowhere near as fun as playing with 3d printed mechanically bonding meshes but it works like a champ.

You can get a sense for how squishy and tough oogoo is from the picture with the ruler. It's easy as pie to sink the (sharp) steel ruler 3mm deep into the oogoo with no damage. I'm guessing the durometer is somewhere between 15-20 which is pretty close to human fingertips.

This particular fingertip looks ugly as sin but with a decent mold it could look downright pretty :)

It may seem far fetched that volunteers will ever use this stuff but it would be pretty easy to prepackage 2oz of FDA approved Type 1 silicone in a foil packet and 1oz of cornstarch in an e-nable kit. It would add about 25 cents to the cost of a kit.

For that matter if we're going to be prepackaging stuff we may as well go straight to smooth-on and get the good stuff (as +Laird Popkin pointed out). Oogoo is fun stuff but it can't begin to compare to what smooth-on can create with 2 part platinum catalysts.

We could get Dragon-Skin or some other custom formulated product pre-packaged in 2oz foil packets for us. If we asked very nicely they might sell us a few 50gallon drums at cost. Getting it packaged in foil packets (like ketchup) isn't terribly difficult.

- Larger pins at larger sizes (less looseness)
- Label ""etched"" into sides and end of palm.
- Supports for fingers
- Google Analytics tracking
- Much improved logging (in the zip file)
- Preview colored parts so easier to see what's what

Maggie has 4 working fingers but no thumb. The quickest and surest solution to her problem is to create a static non-moving thumb that she can use in opposition for either a pinch grip against the index finger or in a power grip for larger items.

This has exciting possibilities for someone like Maggie. Here is a link to an example of the locking loc-line for a dial indicator stem that Eric Griffin posted:

Although Maggie's hand is the immediate application for a loc-line solution. I think there could be others. I'm interested particularly in the joint. You can see from the pictures above that it's just a ball joint. This allows it to move in more than 1 direction.

I'd be curious to see what a full finger actuated on a raptor would look like. Or perhaps using it as just the end joint in a finger. Or maybe just in the knuckle joint. Or perhaps modifying the joint so that the sides are flat so it only moves in 1 plane but retains the ball joint hinge and locking capability. There are a lot of possibilities.

What interests me most about the ball-joint in the loc-line is that it's made of plastic. If it's plastic it's 3d printable. It might be possible to print these and ""polish"" them with acetone. If so it could be awfully fun to play with.

Anybody interested in trying?

We also used a string pull mechanism but we had a servo motor for each finger so you could move them separately (one elastic broke so that's why the finger don't open as it should).

The biggest problem with Oogoo is that it doesn't stick to PLA or ABS. It needs to be mechanically affixed. My first solution was to create a lamination using alternating layers of cotton cloth and oogoo. This can be screwed or riveted.

A better solution for affixing oogoo to a palm or fingertip is to create a surface that will mechanically bond to oogoo. My first thought was an inverted cone or a dovetail within a finger or palm that the oogoo could be molded right into. That way it would be replaceable. Then I started thinking that oogoo is so durable tear resistant it's likely the hand would be destroyed long before the oogoo was ever scratched. If that was the case it might make sense to have it permanently affixed.

This lead me to think that a good way to do it would be to create a surface that creates a mechanical bond with the oogoo. My first thought was create a 3d printed mesh on the surface that you want to apply oogoo to. You'd just print the part with the mesh surface and spread the oogoo on it. When it cured after about 30 minutes it would be permanently affixed. To get it off you'd need to use a right angle grinder or a belt sander or a blast furnace (the latter would be tough on PLA or ABS)

The screenshot you see is of a simple matrix of 2 rows of 3d printed pipes. Each row is 90 degrees to the other. The pipes are about 1mm in diameter and the spaces are about 1mm in diameter. The whole patch is about 40mm in diameter. Ideally the mesh would be sitting on a 2mm flat plate to replicate the surface of a 3d printed palm. The flat plate should overhang the mesh by 1cm or so so that there's something to grip with the fingers/pliers while trying to pry the oogoo off.

What I'd like to do is get an STL file that I can print of this matrix or something like it. I'd like to print it spread some oogoo on it and test the heck out of it. The dimensions don't really matter to much I'd just like to see if this idea will work.

I don't know how to do 3d modeling in a way that will give me an stl. Is there anyone who could do a quick mock-up and post it to thingiverse?

I promised myself that I wouldn't take on any more projects/experiments until the Prosthetic Utility Framework Project was complete. But this idea came to me at 2:00am and was interesting enough to wake me up. Since I had to disassemble the bowden tube hand anyway to fulfill an existing commitment I was happy to rationalize it as stretching that promise rather than breaking it.

The idea that I had was to try to get around Hooke's Law by attaching the return elastic to the tensioning cable itself. By introducing a pulley at the top of the palm the idea was to make it so that the elastic is always in tension (pulling the fingers open) but actually under the same tension through the full articulation of the finger.

In my head it seemed like a sneaky way to get past Hooke's law which holds that the further you stretch an elastic the more force it requires. The downside of Hooke's law is that in the standard configuration the more you close the fingers the harder it gets. This robs the user of a surprising amount of potential gripping force.

What I wound up with was fingers that seem to be in a state of mechanical equilibrium such that they are pose-able in any position the user wants. The upside is that there is nearly 0 tension from the elastic through the full range of motion when the fingers are closing. I say nearly 0 because in actuality the tension from the elastic that is experienced is actually slightly assisting to close the grip rather than open it!

There is an obvious downside to this. The fingers don't return to the open position on their own. In order to open them it's necessary to brush them against you're thigh or some other object. But once you've opened them they stay open. Or half open. Or in any other position you put them in.

I don't know if the upside outweighs the downside but I thought it was an interesting idea that folks might want to play with. There are a lot of ways to play with this idea. Maybe the fingers are in mechanical equilibrium but the thumb has a normal elastic. May a snap pin with a collar printed around it to make a pulley in lieu of a screw. Or maybe something way cooler altogether...

This is what I'm imagining right now. It would just move one of the side walls out a little. It would put the fingers slightly off center but only a little. The idea isn't that you add a dozen spacers as the kid goes from 5 years old to 10 just that he gets to go up one size.

The user would start off with just the left wall attached to the main palm. After he outgrew that he could take off the left wall add in a spacer and put the left wall back on outside of that. Some experimentation would show how big the spacer should be and whether a potential second spacer would be useful.

I first thought about something that would split the hand down the middle but that seems more complicated and problematic. Also having a big gap between the middle fingers might look worse than having the fingers be off center.

For attaching the two main parts and the spacer I'm mainly thinking that a couple of channels for screws could be added to the top of the hand.

This idea was first proposed by +Jason Bryant and I think it's brilliant! I'm highlighting it here because I think it connects a lot of logistical dots from a supply chain management perspective with broad implications from everything to +Enable Matcher new short palm solution to +Jon Schull shoe store model.

One of the things that I've been thinking a lot about is standard sizing in +Jon Schull Shoe Store model. If we were able to statistical analysis of the exact palm sizes of our current 500 users based on the tracker software data we could determine what 5 standard sizes would fit 50% of our future recipients.

+Jorge Zuniga has already done preliminary sizing regression analysis with good results so it makes me think that this could be a workable approach.

https://plus.google.com/112924685807628863357/posts/cwuJhTvZYtA

If we were able to do standard sizing it opens up a whole lot of options. For one we could create inventory of parts that have been assessed for quality. But more interestingly we could start to think about injection molding at some point in the future when designs mature.

An injection mold for a single hand size could be purchased for less than $10k and 2000 hands created at a cost of $5-$10 per hand. All of the parts would be of dramatically better quality right out of the box and at a cost that is less than the current cost per hand. If we're really successful in creating a hand with demand of 10000 units per year globally injection molding might be the only plausible option to satisfy this demand.

+Bob Roth and I were talking about the prospect of injection molding in the distant future. And +Laird Popkin and other's have discussed small batch molding in the more near term.

One thing that would make this standard sizing possible is to segregate the palm into 2 pieces. The first piece of the palm would be the outer shell such as currently exists. The second piece of the palm would be the inner shell which actually customizes the fit to the recipients palm.

You'd use a variation on the brilliant work that +Skip Meetze has done with his printed palm here:

https://plus.google.com/105069495767890395465/posts/7oHm6LBj5Rv

Basically the outer shell might be standardized at 40mm wide by 50mm long for kids 7-9. Then you'd print the inner shell to fit the width correctly and the length correctly. The inner shell could attach to the outer shell via snap pins or screws. Thus you could actually adjust the fit just by changing the inner shell. This would allow for either the stocking of outer shell inventory by either 3d printing or injection molding but still allow for a custom fit for the recipient.

I saw this idea looking at +Carl flood brilliant modular gauntlet design which can be found here:

The first testing tool that I designed attempted to measure the mechanical efficiency of a hand by generating a fixed force on the hand's tendons and measuring the grip force that was generated.

This second tool attempts to measure something very different. It's an attempt to measure how efficient grip configurations are at actually holding an object.

I'll give you an example to illustrate why this second test is important and how it works.

Let's imagine that we have 2 hands that we want to test. The first hand is a mechanical marvel. It has sintered bronze bearings in all the joints teflon coated tendon tubes kevlar tendons and bowden tubes in lieu of elastics. It's 100% efficient due to all of these expensive upgrades such that it can translate 1kg of wrist flexion force into exactly 1kg of gripping force at the fingers. But it has hard slick ABS in all gripping surfaces.

The second hand is just a standard Raptor hand with plastic snap pins elastics and poorly sanded joints. It's only 20% efficienct (1kg of wrist flexion force generates 200grams of finger grip force. But it has thick soft conforming high friction rubber on all gripping surfaces.

Now let's imagine you want to see which one can actually grip objects better in the real world. To do this you take a 1"" diameter chrome cylinder 8"" in length. From this tube you suspend an empty bucket. You use a simple tensioning screw to generate a fixed force of exactly 1kg of force measured by a spring scale to simulate 1kg of wrist flexion. You then place the chrome cylinder in the grip of the hand. Now you start pouring 1 liter of water in the bucket at a slow fixed rate.

Which hand will fail first and drop the bucket? My guess is that the mechanical marvel can't hold the empty bucket. I'd also bet that the Raptor with the grippy high friction rubber on all gripping surfaces can hold the cylinder even with a full liter of water poured into the bucket.

That's basically what this testing rig does. It's purpose is to help us to understand how different grip configurations affect the actual grip strength in the real world. Maybe high friction rubber makes a huge difference. Maybe adding a 3rd phalange makes it worse. Maybe a molded Oogoo palm with 4 raised bumps that mate with the fingers works like magic. We'll never know until we test different gripping configurations with precise force inputs a consistent gripped object and known weights.

You can vary the test by changing the grip input force to 2kg by turning the tensioning screw more. I'd like to test hands in 1kg increments from 1kg - 10kg to see how varying the wrist flexion force affects the amount of weight each grip configuration can hold.

You can also vary the object being gripped. Instead of the chrome cylinder you might try a square or an oval or a rubber ducky.

The reason I designed this test is that I think we need to start engineering friction more effectively. We need to reduce bad friction in the joints and increase good friction in the gripping surfaces. We can't do much to increase the amount of force our recipients can generate with their wrists but we can do an awful lot to increase the effectiveness of their grips by reducing bad friction and increasing good friction.

At any rate that's what I came up with. I'd love to hear your thoughts on how the test can be improved what test would be better or whether or not the test is even useful :)

Here is my first stab at designing a tool to measure the efficiency of e-nable hands. I'm interested to learn which of the existing hand models do the best job of translating the wrist flexion of the user into a useful grip. In theory all the hands should be the same but there are some mechanical gremlins that get in the way:

1. Pin Friction: The snap pins in the Raptor for example are not smooth out of the box. Under load they create a great deal of friction. On my hulk hand with a 10# spring joints sounded like a pepper shaker grinding pepper when the fingers moved even after sanding them for an hour up to 500 grit. This friction robs users of grip strength.

2. Tendon Friction: The tendon lines we use in very coarse unsanded tendon holes generate friction. The standard nylon shade cord that comes in the Cyborg beast kit is about 1.5mm with a relatively coarse braid. Under load those lines drag on the plastic and waste a great deal of energy. The 0.5mm dyneema fishing line likely generates less friction under load. I'd like to measure the difference.

3. Elastic Losses: The elastics that we use to open the fingers consume grip strength. The user has to overcome the elastic resistance to close the grip. Because of Hooke's law the more the fingers are closed the more the elastics are stretched and the harder it becomes to stretch them. They also generate friction while they're stretching. It may not seem like a lot of force to stretch but our users don't have a lot of strength to begin with. I want to measure how much force elastics are consuming.

4. Other: There are lot's of forces at work in these hands we don't fully understand. Testing the hands on a standardized testing apparatus will really help shine light on these unknown complex mechanical gremlins :)

The gizmo that I designed to measure these mechanical forces is generally terrible. It uses 2 turntables that turn independently of one another. The reason it does this is that as the fingers curl the scale that's measuring the finger gripping force needs to spin around to stay perpendicular to the backs of the finger-tips. Turntables were the first things that I thought of to do this.

One nice feature of this design is that it uses a simple screw that is attached a scale which is attached to the tendon lines of the hand. Turning the screw generates gripping force. You turn the screw until you've hit the precise input force you want (1kg). This allows you to control the forces you are putting into the hand in order to get a precise efficiency measurement (force in/force out).

Now that you know that you have exactly 1kg of tendon pull at the wrist you take the measurement on the second scale which is attached to the fingertips by a bar. This output will show grip strength. Let's say the second scale says 100grams. Now you can say that the fingers are operating at 10% efficiency (1kg at the wrist translates to 100grams at the fingertips)

Now you know that 90% of the potential gripping force is being consumed by mechanical gremlins. So you change out the plastic snap pins for Chicago screws. You dial it back up to 1kg of pull at the wrist using the screw. Now you're measurement is 125 grams at the fingertips. With the chicago screws (hypothetically) you've increased the grip strength of the hand by 25%.

Now you take off the elastics and swap in some Bowden cables. You dial it back up to 1kg at the wrist using the screw and you take another measurement at the fingertips which is 175grams. You've increased the grip strength vs the original (hypothetically) by 75% using by changing these 2 components.

Next you swap out the nylon shade cord and swap in some .5mm 100# fishing line. You dial it back up to 1kg at the wrist using the screw and take the measurement at the fingertips which is 200 grams. You've doubled the strength of the grip (purely hypothetically).

Using this tool (or a much better future design) you can determine quantitatively exactly what effect each of the components has to the grip strength of the hand.

You can also play around and at 5kg or 10kg at the wrist to see how increased force effects the friction and the efficiency of the hand. I'd like to generate a grip force curve using 1kg 2kg 3kg 4kg and 5kg.

My device is a terrible design but everyone has to start somewhere. My motto is fail early fail often and fail better next time.

To see an incredible design by +Skip Meetze that is superior in almost every respect take a look at this incredible testing tool for measuring grip efficiency:

My Father showed me this weekend in Maine. It's a silicone repair tape with a 700lb tensile strength that's self fusing. It's really stretchy and you can wrap it around anything for a bomb-proof repair. Lobstermen use it in Maine to do emergency repairs on hydraulic lines radiator lines you name it.

You can wrap it around a hose like hockey tape and when you're done you've got an unbelievably strong repair. I tried wrapping it around fingertips and it worked really well to give a form fitting high friction conforming grip in just a few seconds.

It's a bit expensive but it's really neat stuff. I thought I'd put it out there in case there was someone working on something where this might be handy.

After experimenting with various wires and plastics I gave up on finding what I considered to be a satisfactory way to terminate them.  Somehow it escaped my notice that +Peregrine Hawthorn 's Talon hand used the same push-pull tensioning.  After +Nicholas Hall brought this to our attention I was encouraged to take another look. 

I tried some recently acquired crimp connectors on 1.75mm Taulman Bridge Nylon filament from 3D Universe and it looked promising.  The terminated filament could be wedged into the 100% Raptor fingertip after the channel was reamed out a little with a Dremel tool.  But it still had to be held into place with some hot-glue or something like a 3Doodler.  

Then I discovered that the filament could be doubled over and wedged into the unmodified fingertip and a 1/16 inch hole could be drilled through the assembly.  A peg made from the same filament could hold the tendon in place.  Just mushroom the ends of the peg with a hot iron.

Apparently push/pull lines are called Bowden cables :). I guess I'm about 110 years late to the party on that one.  It also sounds like some folks were experimenting with them this summer  (+Bob Roth and +Alex Thomas).

I figured that since I resurrected an old topic I might as well take a stab at implementing the Bowden cable into a hand.

I stopped off at the hardware store on my way home from work and picked up some 1/4"" OD and 1/2"" OD tubing. This is obviously incredibly oversized for the task but it's what the hardware store had  in stock.

The whole mess is covered in electrical tape so I'll try to describe what I was trying to accomplish.

The most challenging part of the Bowden cable setup using 1.5mm weed-wacker line is the bridge between the palm and the tensioner. When you try to push the WW line forward by flexing the wrist up the WW line wants to bend up into a bow rather than pushing forward into the fingers. The WW line is plenty strong enough for the job but it's a tricky business to overcome this palm/gauntlet bridge hurdle with the Raptor's current design.

The solution I came up with to this problem is something I call a double Bowden tube. I'll describe how I did with tubing and then describe how it would be done in actual practice.

To start off I taped a piece of 1/4"" OD pneumatic tubing that spanned the full length of the palm and gauntlet when the wrist was flexed all the way back. Then I taped a piece of 1/2"" OD pneumatic tubing about 2.5"" long to the gauntlet itself.

When the wrist is bent all the way back (fingers open) the 1/4"" OD tube reaches all the way back to the end of the 1/2""OD tube at the rear of the gauntlet.

When the wrist is bent all the way forward to close the fingers the 1/4"" OD tube glides forward 2"" so that the end of the small tube is .75"" from opening of the large tube.

So there you have it. A Bowden tube within a Bowden tube and you have your bridge. There was surprising little friction the whole assembly is all slick plastic that seemed to just glide forward and backward.

In actual practice that's a lot of unnecessary tubing. The design modifications to the Raptor would be as follows:

Enclose the tendon cables on the top of the Raptor palm. This creates a channel for the WW line to ride in and keeps it from bowing up rather than pushing forward. At the top of the palm where there are currently the 5 tendon guides the holes would stay but would slightly be enlarged 2.5 mm to receive the small bowden tube bridge between the palm and gauntlet. The Bowden tube would be inserted into this and glued into place with superglue. It doesn't receive any tension or do any real work so just tiny bit of superglue is all that would be necessary to hold it in place forever.

On the Gauntlet the Owen's tensioner would be removed entirely. In it's place would be a slightly raised box about 6mm higher than the gauntlet walls. In this box would be 5 holes that were 3mm in diameter which the small Bowden tube would slide in and out of when the wrist was flexed forward and backward (thus replacing the large tube you seen in the video).

The weed-wacker line would be probably be crimped into place at the end of the finger. It would also be crimped at the end of the gauntlet. Tying knots in WW line is a lousy way to spend an evening. The cheapest easiest way I could think to crimp was to just squish a small washer with pliers. It's cheap easy and effective. For the prototype I just used a set screw because it was quick but I don't think that's a good long term solution. You could also shell out $6.00 for some fishing leader crimpers and another penny or two for the crimps

Conclusion: The bridge worked. All you'd need to do to the raptor is enclose the tendon slots in the palm enlarge the tendon guides at the top of the palm add in 5 cents worth of 2.5mm plastic tubing and add lower profile tensioning box with 3mm holes in the gauntlet. Not too much of an overhaul.

I'm not suggesting that this is the best way to do it over even a particularly good way to do it but it glides like butter and it's a cheap solution. It would add a lot more strength into the grip vs the elastic solution especially when the fingers were all the way closed. Another nice feature is that the gauntlet would be significantly shorter without the missile launcher shaped tensioning system rising high above the gauntlet; I think it would be low enough profile to wear under a long-sleeve shirt and not leave any lump.

In any event that's my stab at the Bowden cable configuration. It's not pretty but it worked. I'd love to see some other thoughts on how to tackle the problem.

Peregrine Hawthorn's brilliant new push/pull tendon solution:

I was looking at +Peregrine Hawthorn new video yesterday of his tricked out hand picking up an e-nable water bottle and I saw him mention in the comments that he was using a very unique solution.

I'll leave it up to him to tell you how he did mostly because it's brilliant and it's his idea and partly because I don't totally understand his setup :)

In short the hand can work with no elastics in the fingers! It only has 1 cable which is capable of both pushing and pulling! This is pretty incredible.

The black elastics that we use waste an enormous amount of gripping energy. For small children with weak wrists it's possible that the elastics consume more than 50% of the available gripping strength!

+Adam Arabian and team's solution with dental elastics was a huge leap forward and a brilliant idea; but no elastics whatsoever is pretty tough to beat!

Here are some photos and a short video of my crude attempts to replicate what +Peregrine Hawthorn did. It works surprisingly well.

+Peregrine Hawthorn I can't wait to see how the hand is set up. If you could post some pics and video of the new configuration it would awesome. I'm guessing you had a more elegant solution than my ""masking tape"" approach :)

Most interesting about them is that he uses STLs with specific settings in the slicer which is enough to create the velcro compatible loops (that will stick together with the hooks in velcro).

Another friend who used to treat patients feet (which have anatomical similarities) told me about gel cushioning material velcro compatible backing: http://www.algeos.com/m-gel_sheets_with_hook_backing-3mm_thick.html

For feet it reduces the chance of ulcers especially in older people who have less blood circulation. For a hand it might be less of a concern unless you really use the hand all the time (e.g. carrying a load).

So I was curious to see how well the laminated Oogoo fabric actually worked. It felt pretty strong tugging on it and the lamination had great adhesion between layers but there is only so much force I can generate with my hands.

To give it a more rigorous torture test I snipped the Oogoo fabric with sharp scissors to replicate a 1"" tear then drilled a hole in it with a 1/8"" diameter drill bit. I put a wood screw through the hole and backed it with a small washer. I then tied 15lbs of cast iron weights to the screw and suspended the whole assembly from my basement ceiling. 100% of the weight of the cast iron was pulling directly against the simulated tear.

Amazingly the screw didn't pull through and the fabric lamination didn't tear. That's a whole lot of force. I don't think just regular Oogoo would have held more than 1lb before the screw pulled through or it tore in half.

Conclusion: Laminated Oogoo fabric is more than strong enough to be affixed mechanically to a palm or anything else for that matter.

Another brilliant solution from +Steve Wood who originally suggested coating cotton fabric with Oogoo to reinforce it.

Taking a look at +Skip Meetze amazing new palm cushion from what looks like a printed 3d mold got me thinking about the best way to attach Oogoo to a palm.

The trouble with the stuff is that for all it's great properties (elasticity durability etc) it has one big achilles heal which was pointed out by +Steve Wood :

1. Like most silicones and elastics it'd incredibly durable until it is torn or cut. Once cut the cut propogates through the whole piece if you put it under tension. This is a problem because if you drill it to mechanically affix to something because the hole becomes a very weak point in the structure

2. It's really trick to glue to it. Regular superglue won't stick to it. There are glues that apparently will but they're not something you can get right off the shelf.

Looking at Skip's picture of his marvelous molded Oogoo palm got me to thinking about how to make a bombproof attachment method that would overcome the two limitations listed above. +Steve Wood suggested two solutions: coating cotton like you see here or maybe mixing bits of fiber would work ( I still haven't tried that but it's a cool idea).

Then it hit me. I was a conveyor belt technician for a good part of my early 20's. If you're ever been to a supermarket you've seen a conveyor belt. If you flipped it over you would see that it's just rubber glued to several ply's of thick nylon fabric in a sandwich.

So I grabbed an old t-shirt to see if I could replicate this with Oogoo. I mixed up a batch with the following recipe:

3 tblsp type 1 silicone
1 tsp of 99.5% glycerine (costs $5.00 for 6oz at any drugstore)
1 tsp of cornstarch
1 tsp of cheap artist acrylic ($0.50 at Walmart)

I then spread the ogoo in a thin 2mm layer with my mixing spoon on top of a square of old t-shirt. The wet Oogoo soaked right through the fabric! Next I laid a new cotton t-shirt square and repeated this process. I did a 4 ply lamination. Then I put a big blob of Oogoo on top of the whole mess and left it cure.

It worked!

Now the fabric prevents the Oogoo from ripping or tearing. You can drill it cut it sew it etc. There are also a gazillion fabrics that might work better than old t-shirts.

Does anyone have a suggestion as to what kind of fabric might work best?

This is made with nylon 618 most of the Taulman nylons will work. It uses living hinges and complex geometry to achieve deflection when force is applied in one axis. I think this could quite easily be modified to allow single print fingers for the various hand designs. Also with the living hinge concept one should be able to reduce the parts and assembly time.

I recently took a look at the Falconv1 hand on thingiverse. I had never seen it before. If you haven't seen this hand you should take a few minutes to have a look. It's pretty incredible. I'd go into detail in the number of ways that it's incredible but you'll be able to see for yourself pretty quickly. +Adam Arabian and his team should be really proud of this one.

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:418398/#files

Of the many wonderful features of the hand the one that stuck out the most is the by far the simplest. Dental elastics!

The hand uses dental elastics to return the fingers to the fully open position in lieu of the black elastic cord that we use. There are several benefits to this:

1. Efficiency: The black elastics that we use to return the fingers to an open position consume a surprising amount of energy. This is especially true when picking up small objects which requires the fingers to fully close. This is because of Hooke's law which roughly states that the force required to stretch an elastic or spring increases the more you stretch it. Our recipients especially small children have very little wrist strength to begin with. They need to translate as much of that limited force as possible to gripping. I think it's likely that the elastics consume as much as 50% of the total potential gripping force that a small child can produce! I believe that elastic bands are substantially more efficient because they do need to stretch the full length of the finger. After the proximal phalange has made it's full 90 degree rotation there is no additional stretching. We need to build a testing apparatus to confirm this but it's intuitive that the elastic bands consume dramatically less energry. That means more gripping strength available to our little recipients to use their hands more effectively.

2. Assembly Time: One of the criteria that I think it is important to measure a hand by is the assembly time required. It takes about 10-15 minutes to thread and tie off the elastic cord. It takes just 10-15 seconds to slip on 5 elastic bands.

3. Maintenance: The black elastic cord that we use stretches out over time and loses it's elasticity. Before long the recipient is going to need to replace it. Currently they'll have to find a source for the elastics pay for shipping watch the video on how to install them and then spend the 10-15 minutes to replace them. Dental elastics are simplicity themselves to install. Even a 7 year old boy can figure out what needs to be done and get the job done in under a minute. Additionally every orthodontic office in the country has drawers full of these things and would likely give them away for free.

4. Kitting: For the Raptor hands I think it would be great to do a very simple kit that contains the tensioning cord and elastic. To make a kit currently it's necessary to measure out the elastic cut it with scissors roll it up in a coil and place it in a plastic bag. With elastics it's possible to just grab 10 of them and stick them in a bag. Because the elastic bands are so light they also cost less to ship. I think a full Raptor kit with padding foam dental elastics and tension cord could be shipped in a regular envelope for just 49 cents here in the US.

In short that's my long winded plug for using dental elastics on Raptor v2 and future hands that our talented hand designers are working on.

Those are the benefits that I see to using elastics and I can't think of any drawbacks. Can folks think of ways in which the elastics cord is superior to dental elastics for returning fingers to the fully open position? I'm sure there are some I just can't think of them at the moment.

This was kind of what I was picturing. Incorporating a graduated block and tackle into the back plate of the hand. 

Problems I see with this (aside from my near-total lack of math and engineering):
1. Force is no longer running in nice straight lines and could cause extra lateral stresses on the gauntlet.
2. More moving fiddly bits.
3. How much 'rope' we have available to actually allow the cam to do its work.

Benefits:
1. Retains the built-in adaptive grip provided by the palm side elastics.
2. Perhaps fewer tiny knots to manage. (Though greater impact from cable failure.)

Building a normally closed hand actuated by strong elastic tubing highlighted for me the unfortunate implications of Hooke's law which states that the more you stretch a spring (or elastic) the more force it requires (thanks +Nick Parker). It's pretty obvious and anyone with an ounce of common sense understands this intuitively but I had to build a normally closed hand to fully understand how poor my design was.

The trouble with my configuration with the elastics in the palm is that the hand had very little gripping strength in the fully closed position and took increasingly huge forces to open the fingers to full extension.

Putting the elastics in the palm seems like a pretty good spot for a couple of reasons though.

1. If you put the elastics on the top of the gauntlet like I did with the ""speargun raptor"" it will tend to pull the wrist backwards as well as pulling the grip closed. This can be overcome by a latching mechanism on the hinge or a stop block between the top of the palm and the gauntlet but these are hardly elegant solutions.
2. I want to have a molded palm anyway and it seems like a waste of space and weight to have the full palm be Oogoo. Why not embed 1/4"" PEX tubing through the molded palm with the elastics going through the tubing. You save weight and protect the elastics.

That said because of Hooke's Law this is a pretty lousy place to put elastics which became obvious as soon as I had built the hand!

Thankfully there is an exception to Hookes Law. That exception is the constant force spring. As the name would imply this is a spring that exerts exactly the same force no matter how far you stretch it.

This is wonderful for my normally closed hand configuration with the springs in the palm because it means that I can achieve exactly the same gripping force through the full range of motion of the fingers. Nifty!

I plan to stack 4 small ones in the palm embedded within the Oogoo molded palm protected by a plastic housing. I want to have mounds in the palm anyway why not put something in them? This will be pretty neat to try.

They only cost about $2.00 each and can generate 1lb of force and come in a diameter less than an 3/4"". One lb of force per finger may not sound like much but I think it's way more gripping force than current fingers are capable of exerting.

Even more interesting it will be possible to vary the size of the springs for each finger. The thumb forefinger and pinky may get the strongest springs and the two middle fingers somewhat less. I think this could generate a variety of grip configurations more efficiently although it's possible it will just cause the fingers to close at a different rate. I guess I'll find out.

But there's one more really interesting application for these springs. The current black elastic that we use for all our hands to open the fingers are not terribly efficient. Because of Hooke's law they consume an increasing amount of force to elongate the further the grip is closed. That problem can be solved by constant force springs.

It wouldn't be necessary to use 5 of them. A single spring could be secured in a small housing in the top of the palm and connected multiple opening tendon lines. These springs come in very tiny sizes. This way the same resistance would be experienced by the user regardless of how far the grip closed. And what's more it will be possible to size the spring with great precision. A 180% scaled hand will need a different spring than a 65% scaled spring for a 4 year old. This may violate the ""easily sourced"" ethos but I'm very curious how much more efficient it could make the hands especially for small children with very little wrist strength.

I've been thinking quite a bit about grip strength. Both how to increase it and how to measure it. But after playing around with my normally closed Raptor actuated by strong elastics I got to thinking about grip efficiency. The hands seem to require an enormous amount of force input to achieve a relatively small grip force output.

Factors like friction and dynamics of the grip matter tremendously. This became readily apparent after placing very large forces on the hand in a direction it was never intended to go. The friction was considerable. The joints were not at all happy. But this just highlighted to me that the same thing must be occurring with relatively lesser forces; it's just less perceptible.

A few things that struck me were:

1. The friction of the tension cord consumes no small amount of force. In fact the more gripping force that is generated the more energy that friction consumes. If that's the case it could be that the default shade cord that comes in the Cyborg Beast kit isn't the right cord for the job. It has a very large diameter ~2mm and consequently a very large surface area and therefore it generates quite a bit of friction. The 100# dyneema fishing line is .5mm and it stands to reason that it creates substantially less friction due to this surface area.

2. The joints themselves generate enormous friction which  increases in proportion to the force placed on them. They're like butter when there is little force however when you put them under increasing load you can hear the friction. I took a great deal care to sand them each progressively from 200grit all the way up through 500grit to make them as smooth as possible. Even so I could hear the friction when opening the hand. This made me wonder how snap pins compare in efficiency relative to chicago bolts which have a much smoother surface.

3. The small elastic used in the normally open configuration may well consume as much force in elongating as is generated for the grip especially in smaller children with minimal wrist strength. If a child is only able to produce 1kg of wrist flexion force and that translates into .2kg of potential gripping force in the fingers and the elastics consume 0.1kg the poor kid only has 0.1kg of gripping force left over (he's lost half his potential gripping force to the elastic). What's worse it does so at precisely the worse possible point in the grip (when the grip is fully closed). This is due to the fact that the elastic creates more resistance the further it is stretched.

I could go on but all of this stuff is probably obvious to the majority of you. It's new to me but my mechanical aptitude barely qualifies me to change a tire let alone design a hand!

In any event adding large forces to the hand via strong elastic tubing really highlighted for me how each of the things listed above impact the efficiency of the hand. I was initially interested in measuring grip strength but I realize that it's much more precise to say that what I'm interested in measuring is grip efficiency.

Presumably I'm not the first person to wonder about this and since there some talented and brilliant engineers hackers and tinkerers in the bunch it strikes me as likely that someone has rigged up an apparatus to test the efficiency of the hands.

So I guess my question is has anyone tested the efficiency of the hands by measuring how much force on the tension wire is required to generate a given gripping force? If so can you post your results and a picture of your testing apparatus?

I've been thinking about how to do it using spring balances and clamps and all manor of gadgets but I realize I'm probably the least qualified person in the world to figure out how to do this effectively!

This normally closed hand was built using 10# elastic tubing intended for fitness/strength training. It's really strong stuff. The elastic tubing is actually routed through the palm not over the gauntlet.  It gives a wonderfully strong grip. Maybe too strong. Opening the hand takes way too much power in the existing configuration. I call it the Hulk hand both because it's green and because the biggest challenge is figuring out how to control the power :) It's not worth much right now but it's a good starting point.

It's not even close to a finished product it still needs a lot of work. Getting a good grip is one thing opening it easily is is entirely another. It may need that marvelous ratchet assembly +Erik de Bruijn has been working on. The point of this project was to see how much grip could be achieved with a Raptor hand and what additional functionality a better grip could offer. It's really just a starting point and an interesting case study in what these Raptor hands are capable of. These hands are sturdy! Now I just have to figure out the opening part :)

The hand only has 4 fingers because my recipient has a thumb and this hand is just a leftover that wasn't sized correctly. My goal is to have a hand ready for him to canoe when summer camp starts up next year. I think it's an achievable goal.

Molded Palm: A new feature in this hand is the molded palm which is made of Oogoo. The recipe for Oogoo is just cornstarch and a $3.00 tube of silcone. Here is the link to the instructable where I got the recipe:

http://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Make-Your-Own-Sugru-Substitute/

There are large bumps on the palm that mate with the fingers when closed. The palm looks ugly but it works like a champ. Ultimately I'd like to create 3d printable molds that scale with the hand. You'd print your hand print the mold whip up a $1.00 batch of Oogoo in 5 minutes fill the mold and have a custom fit palm and fingertips ready to go after a 10 minutes of work and a 1hr cure time. Alternatively it could be printed in Filaflex for those who have upgraded their printer with the right extruder; this is another reason why I need to put an upgraded extruder on my shortlist.

Molded Fingertips: This hand has some incredibly ugly Oogoo fingertips. I whipped up a batch as an afterthought and just slathered some on. It's wonderfully elastic durable stuff and at 4mm thick it molds around shapes just like our fingers do. This dramatically improves the grip performance. They can be much prettier if made in a 3d printed mold.

Adaptive Grip: This hand has a nifty adaptive grip. Take a look at the grip that it has around the pepper shaker. I knew it work work in theory but actually seeing it do it was wonderful.

Pen Holding!: This thing can hold a pen and take notes thanks to the molded palm. Check out the video.

Paper Holding: It can pick up a sheet of paper as easily as it can pick up a ream of paper. This is due to the molded palm.

Fork Holding: Same trick as the pen. A molded palm makes a world of difference. Take a look at the pic of it skewering a banana and picking it up with ease. This think has a wonderful grip for thin objects like pens forks knives etc. Take a look at it holding a very heavy 8"" chef's knife with a full forged blade (it's 3/16"" thick on the back of the blade).  You could chop and dice an onion with this hand!

Egg Holding: This thing has a wicked grip but not as much as you might think. It doesn't take that strong of a grip to hold heavy objects; the key is the molded palm and fingers. It can pick up an egg or a banana without crushing them. In truth I was a bit worried about the egg :)

I've basically been walking around my kitchen picking up everything but the kitchen sink. It can pick up a frying pan in it's grip like it's nothing. A 7# triple ply stainless steel and copper pot was a breeze. You'll note in the photo that it was able to pick it up from just the side which is only 2mm thick thanks to the molded palm.

What was really cool was picked up a pen as an afterthought. Then it occured to me that I could just sit down and write a note with the hand. I shot a video of me doing it. The handwriting was a bit messy but that was in large part because I was watching myself write through the viewfinder in my phone which was a bit disorienting. But who cares about the handwriting: the Raptor hand can take notes!

In future iterations I'd like to route the elastics through 1/4"" PEX tubing and mold the whole assembly inside of a molded Oogoo palm. This will protect the elastics integrate a molded palm and generally be fun to play with.

I'll be creating a more in depth posting of how this hand was built and the engineering challenges it presents on a website that pointed me too. It's called http://buildinprogress.media.mit.edu/. It's sort of like instructables but with a twist. It's purpose built to document a project while it's in progress and most importantly to collaborate with others on the project. You can post pictures designs cad files etc. Other contributors can post add in their own content and files as well.

What I'd love to see happen is for all the disparate projects that are being worked on to have a home where they can be visible at http://buildinprogress.media.mit.edu/. It would be great to have a forum for projects where we can collaborate with each other and where projects will be documented for future e-nablers to see. That way we can stop reinventing the wheel and we can start cross pollinating ideas. Right now though I'm off to bed!

Conclusion: I think the normally closed hand has real potential but there is a lot of work left to be done.

My daughter Maggie is 8 yrs old and was born with a rare condition called VACTERL Association.  In short VACTERL stands for : Vertebral Anal  Cardiac  Tracheal Esophaeal Renal and Limb.  She was born with a shorten radius and no thumb on her right hand.  We saw an article about 3D printers in our local newspaper and it mentioned E-nable. So we thought we would try and ask here if anyone would be willing to make a hand device but  with a thumb (she already has the four fingers).  Without the thumb it makes it hard to grasp some things and she has to do it between her index and middle finger and at times this can be very uncomfortable for her.  There is surgery to 'fix' this problem but that requires the removal of the index finger and sliding it down  which would change her hand. Not to mention my daughter has had 15 surgeries in her short life  this would be elective and she does not want anymore surgery ( if we can help it).  I would love to see if this could help others born this way without having to resort to painful and expensive surgery.  If anyone is willing to take this on please let us know.

So I got to playing in my basement with silicone glycerine cornstarch and cheap 50 cent artist acrylics. I was pretty excited by the results. This stuff is super fun to play with. Try it!

Let me know if the video seems jerky. I uploaded it directly to the site. If it's jerky I'll try uploading to youtube and linking.

Results:

Color: The Oogoo takes color really well. You can see in the videos that it takes on brilliant colors. It just takes a few drops of artist acrylic

Durometer: +Luis Herranz  helpfully pointed out in the earlier post that varying the amount of cornstarch significantly changes the elasticity and squishiness (durometer) of the Oogoo. You make it hard like an eraser by adding more cornstarch or soft like an elastic by adding less.

Glycerine: This was my favorite stuff to add. The red piece in the video made by adding just 2 tablespoons of silicone and 8 drops of glycerine (no cornstarch at all). It rapidly turns into an amazing silcone just like you find on a store bought spatula. The tricky part is that it cures almost too quickly you've got about 5 minutes to form it and it's already started to cure. Adding a bit of cornstarch seemed to slow down the set time. I've heard adding mineral spirits will slow the cure time and turn it into more of liquid for molding. I bought the glycerine for $5.00 at the drug store.

Friction wastes a lot of energy. A great deal of the limited mechanical force our recipients are able to generate with their wrist is lost to friction in the finger joints.

I noticed this when I put together my first hand and realized that I hadn't sanded the joints nearly enough. I could feel the resistance in the joints from PLA scraping PLA. Once I had taken the hand apart again and resanded everything the action was significantly smoother.

This got me thinking about lubricants. Anyone who's ever put a drop of oil on a squeaky hinge can attest to the seemingly miraculous improvement of the hinge joint. Suddenly the door that was hard to open now seems to swing with the slightest breeze.
I believe the same could be true for our PLA/ABS fingers.

The obvious problem is that you don't want to put chain grease on a child's prosthetic hand. They'll be holding bananas and picking up grapes; there are also implications for skin irritation.

Then I started thinking about food machinery. It needs to lubricated too. A short google search later and I found that there are a gazillion FDA approved lubricants for food processing machinery. The picture is the a tube of mineral oil based lubricant. You can spread it on toast and eat it you wanted.

I'm not an engineer and I know nothing about lubrication but I think it's an interesting question. Would lubricating the joints with food grade lubricant improve the performance of the fingers? If so what lubricant do you think would work best for the application?",,,,,,,,

This would be great stuff for tensioning cables on hands.

I like that this stuff is thick enough to distribute the load across a wider area.

The 400# rating is overkill of course but at 30 feet for $12.99 with free shipping (if you have Amazon Prime) seems like a good deal. You can get 100ft of white nylon lift cord but 100ft is way more than you could hope to use in a year; I also don't love the white color.

So I was thinking about grip dynamics this afternoon while I was watching the NY Jets game. If you're a Jet's fan you understand why I wanted something to take my mind off the game :)

In any event I started thinking about the importance of the palm when gripping. Our own palms do a lot of work when picking up large objects. Try picking up a a waterglass by just the rim without using your thumb to see one example of what I mean. Your fingers can grip this wide object by pressing the glass between your fingers and your palms. Our prosthetic hands can't do this.

The palm of the Raptor is flat. The only gripping surface on is the slippery back part of the velcro that secures the user's actual palm. This offers no friction grip and no mechanical grip. You can see in the pictures above how I set about improving this.

The material I used is called Oogoo. It's pretty awesome stuff. All you need to make it is a tube of normal 100% Silicon that you find in any hardware store and cornstarch. Ironically the expensive type II silicon doesn't work; the stuff you need is the dirt cheap $3.00 a tube stuff. You squirt 2 parts silicon out of a tube into a plastic cup and then add in 1 part cornstarch. The cornstarch acts as a catalyst and allows you to cure any thickness of silicon incredibly quickly. You stir it with a Popsicle stick until it is fully mixed. After about 4 minutes it starts to set. It can be molded like clay in this formulation. Alternatively you can add in a bit of mineral spirits and get a pourable version. You can probably do 10-15 palms with one tube. So it only cost about 25 cents to do a palm.

I formed the rather ugly palm above in about 2 minutes on a piece of wax paper. It was essentially cured after about an hour. You can see from the pictures how it transforms the gripping ability of the palm. The hand in the pictures isn't fully built in fact it's held together by drinking straws rather than snap pins. You get the general idea of how the gripping action works just the same.

What really interests me is the potential of printing out palm molds and finger molds right on a build plate. A pourable version of Oogoo would be ideal for this. You'd print the fingers in ABS and you'd print the mold. You'd take the fingers off the build plate snap them into place right in the mold and pour Oogoo into the perfectly scaled mold. Likewise you'd pull the palm mold off the plate pour in the Oogoo and have a ready made high friction highly elastic gripping palm and grippy fingers in 5 minutes for less than the cost of a pack of gum.

The palm I designed above has exaggerated bumps and probably isn't the best design. I think a more anthropomorphic palm could be designed. Or perhaps more bumps smaller in diameter and height is the right solution. The great thing is that any shape can be created quickly easily and cheaply to experiment with what works best.

I think Steve Woods would be the first to point out that this same end could be accomplished using Filaflex which is marvelous stuff that I wish more of us could print. I guess my overall point is that the palm is a weak point in our existing designs that I think we could easily improve.

I'd love to hear what guys think. Is it even worth doing? Do the palms need to be improved? How would you propose to change the palms to improve gripping?

I decided to take a break from my quixotic obsession with normally closed hands and take a stab at implementing two of the normally closed hands best features into an otherwise standard Raptor with a normally open grip.

It can move between normal Raptor mode and lock grip mode by stretching the elastics and locking them against a simple hook at the back of the gauntlet. In lock grip mode the grip is fully adaptive; it allows each finger to independently conform to any shaped object.  It also uses speargun elastics and speargun fittings which is fun in and of itself :)

Instead of the tendons being attached to the front of the guantlet like a standard Raptor with an Owen's tensioner the tendons go through the whole block and are held against the back of it with a simple fishing line crimp. This allows the hand to operate as a normal Raptor does most of the time (normally open grip)

However the big change is that the tendon lines are now able to move backwards towards the back of the gauntlet freely (they can move backwards but are not able move past the tension block due to the fishing line crimp). This allows for the introduction of 5 speargun elastics roughly 3 inches in length (Speargun Elastics!). The speargun elastics are can be enormously powerful and come in a variety of diameters to adjust grip strength.

Simple fittings are inserted into each end of the speargun tube and attached on one end to the tendons and on the other end to a buckle.

To engage the adaptive lock grip the other hand is used to stretch the elastic and secure the buckle around a hook at the back of the gauntlet. If you want to get fancy you can add a couple of hooks to vary the grip strength (not shown in the pictures but easy to do).

The grip is disengaged manually by releasing the buckle. When this happens the tendon lines simply slide back against the tensioner block and the hand goes right back to being a normal raptor functionally.

I designed this particular contraption as an experiment to see if I can build a hand that my recipient can use for canoeing but there are a variety of activities that call for a strong sustained grip: biking umbrella holding dog walking briefcase carrying you name it. The nice thing about the grip is that it is full adaptive.

In any event that's what I put together tonight but the wheels are still spinning. I'd love to hear what folks think of it. If anyone is interested I could use some help with getting a 3d designed prototype that I can print out. You can see from the pictures that I have only the barest grasp of sketchup; extending the gauntlet length and adding the hook is well beyond my meager modeling skills.

In any event the pictures should give a pretty good idea of how it works. I'd love to hear what you guys would do to improve upon it.

I've got a pie in the sky type thought that I'd normally just shut up about since its FAR removed from my area of expertise

However with the Johns Hopkins event and all the members that we have with a medical background I figured I'd throw it out there and if theres something in it and the right people are thinking about it possibly it'd be something we could see in the future. Here goes (I might be totally off base so I apologize in advance if this is stupid)

Its my understanding that most of the conditions that we deal with here (where theres a residual palm due to ABS or other conditions) all the kids are missing fingers. The muscles and flexor tendons are there

What if you could carry out a surgery to ""extend"" these flexor tendons? cut open the palm for example find each one of the tendons and attach a cable to the ends of each (with a sheath or tube around it). When you close the hand back up you'll have 4 cables sticking out the top of the residual palm

Now if you attached a 3D printed palm and fingers to the users residual palm and used these extended tendons as the driving tendons for the fingers you'd be able to drive each one of the 3D printed fingers just like a normal finger. Not depending anymore on flexion of the wrist. Granted the users might require some time to ""train"" the dormant muscles in order to get full functionality.....

Would be nice to have something like this on the horizon that brings functionality without reliance on wrist motion or batteries for myoelectric versions.....",,,,,,,,

I was so smitten with the brilliant work that +christian silva did on that amazing aluminum metalized hand using the High Vacuum process that I had to see what I could do with the tools that were available to me.

Even so it does look kind of cool. It's enough to make my inner 10 year old smile which I guess counts for something. I think it would be nice to pair it with a light stainless steel for a color combo. Maybe just a matte black.

I tried it on a test piece that I got from a failed gauntlet print (the shadow in the center is the dovetail slot) but I'm curious to try it on a full test hand some day. I think a simple 1k clear coat would probably really make it pop and add considerable durability to the finish.

I'm working on a project to measure the grip strength of the Raptor Cyborg Beast and Talon hands and I need some help. I need some thoughts on what methodology is going to give the best measurements at the lowest cost. I'd like to get a dozen or so testers preferably actual recipients to perform the measurements. Here are some options I've thought of:

Measuring Methodology:

Option 1: Occupational Therapist Dynamometer: Ideally recipients should be under the care of an occupational therapist in using the hands. These practitioners will likely have access to  well calibrated professional quality tools to measure the grip strength of the hands. A standardized methodology for measurement would be established to ensure consistency of the measurements.

Option 2. Economy Hand Dynamometer ($28): http://www.amazon.com/Camry-Electronic-Hand-Dynamometer-Strength/dp/B005EPKXXA/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1412351691&sr=1-1&keywords=dynamometer

The hand dynaometer is placed in the hand in the nearly closed position and the user squeezes the grip closed to measure grip strength. Max grip strength is automatically recorded and digitally displayed.

Problem: I'm guessing the grip strength of the average user is less than 1kg. The equipment may not be accurate at these low grip strengths.

Option 3. Spring Scale ($5.30: http://www.amazon.com/Ajax-Scientific-Spring-Balance-Capacity/dp/B00EPQGMF2/ref=pd_sbs_indust_7?ie=UTF8&refRID=1ZHBYAANN095JPG5MR0A

Grip Measurement: A finger trapeze would be made with a pencil and two pieces of string (the same non-stretching spectra cord we use for the fingers). The two pieces of string would be tied to each end of the pencil and then to one another. This would create a triangle. The two pieces of string would be hitched to the hook of the spring scale. The Mounting ring of of the spring scale would be affixed to an immovable object like a wall desktop etc. The user would start the measurement in the fully open position. Keeping the wrist and forearm immobilized the user would close the fingers and read the maximum reading on the scale. Three measurements of this would be made and the results averaged.

Problem: If the travel of the spring in the scale is too long the finger would close before a maximum reading could be taken. I don't think the average user will be able to create more than 0.5 kg of grip strength so using a 3kg scale should minimize the travel but still provide 40 gram resolution.

Option 4: Food Scale ($15.00): http://www.amazon.com/EatSmart-Precision-Digital-Kitchen-Silver/dp/B001N07KUE/ref=sr_1_3?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1412351876&sr=1-3&keywords=food+scale

The user would grip this in the hand in the fully closed position and take the reading from the scale.

Problem: Most digital scales take time to read and may not get a reading if the weight/force is variable. Mechanical scales that I've seen tend to be quite large and the wrong shape to work in this application.

I'd love to hear what you think might work or additional problems with the ideas listed above.

One thing that I've been thinking a lot about recently is how to align prosthetic utility with the future hand design innovations. The existing designs are remarkable and they're getting even better. One thing that I think that can be really helpful in aligning new hand designs with usefullness for user's is developing an e-NABLE framework/criteria for prosthetic utility.

If we have something as simple as a set of 10 measurable criteria that hands can be judged against it will be possible to benchmark existing designs and evaluate future innovations. The criteria should be aligned with actual usefulness for users. Consider this simple example using 10 criteria:

1. Maximum Grip Strength: Measured by actual hand dynamometer measured maximum grip strength by the evaluator. The variability of actual user grip strength is accounted for by the same evaluator using existing hand models to compare measured grip strength between models. The score on this could be on a scale of 1 to 10 with a 1kg grip being a score of 1 and a 10kg grip being a score of 10. Current hands might be at a 1 right now.

2. Pincer Grip Ability: Measured by how many marbles of varying size (out of 60 marbles) the user can pick up out of a bowl and place them in an adjacent bowl in 60 seconds. The more marbles that can be picked up the better the hand. A score of 1 would be less than 5 marbles and a score of 10 would be 60 marbles.

3. Average Grip Strength: Measured by the grip strength measured on a hand dynamometer at 20 second intervals for 5 minutes. This measures the efficiency of the of the grip. A normally closed hand would excel in this test whereas a normally open design would have more difficulty. An average grip strength of 1kg would would be a score of 1 and an average score of 10kg would be a score of 10.

4. Pinch Grip Strength Adjustability: This test would require the user to alternate between picking a grape out of a bowl unharmed and squishing a 1cm ball of silly putty flat in 60 seconds. 20 Grapes and 20 silly putty spheres. A score of 1 would be less than 5 of each a score of 10 would be all 20 grapes and all 20 spheres flat.

5. Grasping Adjustability: This test would require the user to pick up various household objects and move them from one tray to another. The objects could be a can of soup a 5lb barbell a pencil a washer a magazine a paperclip kitchen knife a roll toilet paper etc. A score of 1 would be 5 movements a score of 10 would be 60 movements.

6. Durability: Measured by taping a brick around the palm of the hand and dropping it from increasing height in 1 foot increments. The hand is dropped until no longer functional. A score of 1 might be a 4 foot maximum drop as score of 10 might be a drop from 10 feet.

7. Cost: Measured by the total cost to produce the hand including filament hardware and fasteners. A score of 1 would be $200 and a score of 10 would be $25.

8. Ease of Assembly: Measured by total assembly time based on user provided instructions for a hand with a palm of 50mm by 80mm. A score of 1 would be 3 hours and a score of 10 would be 30 minutes.

9. Eating and Writing Facility: The hand would alternate between lifting a fork and spearing a grape and lifting up a pencil and writing the word e-nable legibly in 60 seconds. A score of 1 would be 2 of each a score of 10 would would be 20 grapes and 20 words.

10. Aesthetics: Measured by how many seconds an 8 year old child can resist picking up the hand and trying it on. A score of 1 would be the child hiding it under a napkin a score of 10 would be the child putting it on in under 5 seconds. This isn't really a very good test but I ran out of ideas :)

The objective would be to have a total point score for each hand. The Raptor might have a score of 15 today if we ran the test. The goal is to get a hand with a score of 100.

The results of the tests would be published on the e-nable website for each hand. A score board would be created to keep track of which individuals were making the greatest contribution to making our dream hand. This could be incredibly powerful in and of itself.

People are naturally competitive. Engineering schools are even moreso. Right now I think there's a good bet that RIT and Creighton would be able to produce a pretty high score. I think Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Cal Tech might find it galling not to outdo them. Steve Woods and Aaron Brown working alone might keep both institutions on their toes with their amazing contributions. If we could harness the brilliance and energy that Robotics competitions engender we could achieve amazing things.

This would be an ongoing competition and not an annual event. The challenge with an annual competition is that people procrastinate. This would be an open competition with submissions possible at any time. If a team had a hand that they believe could increase the cumulative score above the existing benchmark hand by 5 points they could submit it immediately for evaluation. This would create a sense of urgency to submit innovations quickly before another team does. The new high scoring hand would be become the new benchmark hand. You would need to outdo it by 5 points to submit a hand for evaluation. This would force teams shy of the 5 point mark to collaborate with other teams also just shy of the mark to combine their innovations. That's a good thing!

If we really wanted to get fancy we could endow the competition with $100000. Each point of increased utility (out of a possible 100) would receive a $1000 research grant. The purpose would be to reward amazing innovation and productivity with additional funding to buy software licenses upgrade equipment and to invest in new materials and experimentation.

Regardless of whether or not money was involved the framework above would be tremendously powerful. It would align actual user utility with the score for the hands. Designers could easily see what hands are currently doing poorly and what they should be doing better. A great example is a functioning pincer grip with an opposable thumb. We have dozens of brilliant designers but only Skip Meetze is working on one as far as I know. Just that innovation alone will bring untold usefulness to our recipients. The scoring matrix above heavily weights the score of the hand to it's ability to perform this vitally useful operation.

Naturally work will need to be done in order to align prosthetic utility with the scoring matrix and tasks. At this point we haven't done enough work thinking about what will make our hand the most useful. Here is a paper highlighting all research into prosthetic utility measurements done from 1970 to 2009. I'd say that's a pretty good starting point.

The raptor build I did seemed a bit thin in the tendon channels. I held it up to the overhead light to highlight how thin it is. You can tell from the light coming through that it's just only about ~1mm thick.

My concern is that this area will be prone to cracking/fracture in the event of an impact. My recipient is an 11 year old boy and I can imagine this thing getting some hard use (in fact I hope it does!)

Is this the normal thickness of the Raptor in this area? Could something have gone wrong in the slicing or scaling that may have caused this?

One thing I thought about trying was to increase the ""number of shells"" in makerbot or repetier. Would increasing the ""Shell"" thickness improve the issue or would it just cause unintended consequences? My understanding is that the shells build towards the center to replace infill so it shouldn't affect the sizing of parts. That said I'm not sure that it would make any difference because there is no infill in this portion to speak of. Thoughts?

Im a new member to E-Nable and had the good fortune of viewing a recorded session of the google R&D Hangout on the 29th of September. Some key points I took from the conversation:

1. Revision/Version Control
This is a very common issue in design environments. At my old job we solved this with product lifecycle management which tracks revs and also who made the revision. We could look into some of the open source versions out there and see if that meets our needs. That said maybe somebody like Dassault Systems could donate a few licenses to E-Nable considering the scope of work you guys do. 
I have another solution as well which involves the use of part/assembly configurations. I have used configs in SolidWorks and Pro-Engineer (Now Creo) before and its a great way of working upwards of a base model. Let me know what you guys think. I could start on something like that on SolidWorks which would entail:
1. A base model (one we all agree on which is basically the starting point of our design)
2. Changes done in the form of additional configurations.
3. This will keep all part/assembly data in one part/assembly and will help keep track of changes. We can figure out how to name the configs. An example naming convention could be:
CONFIG NUMBER_PERSON MAKING THE MODIFICATION_DATE
such as
C_TALHAHASAN_2014.10.1

I also took a keen interest in the dicussion regarding locking and actuation mechanisms. I have a few ideas and am going to start work on them today. I will keep you guys posted on any progress I make and possibly share some images of my designs for critique.

Well I printed out a Raptor today for my recipient and all went well except for one thing. When I went to tie off the elastic for the pinky the little tie off bar in on top of the center of the palm broke off. I think this piece could use a bit of additional reinforcement in the design.

I was able to fix it by drilling two holes through the palm in roughly the same spot so it's not a deal breaker. It's also just a PLA hand that I'm sending my recipient to test the fit and ergonomics before I do the final print in ABS so it's not critical that it isn't perfect.

Is this an issue that other folks had at the conference?

I tried using the new Raptor Handomatic using the link provided by +Ro Ortiz a few days ago. The user interface has been streamlined and it's beautiful to behold. The handomatic team has done some amazing work!

I'm building a thumbless left hand for my current recipient and I was really pleased to see that this option was built right into the handomatic. What I was really surprised to see was that my actual recipients photo was the default photo on the handomatic for the sizing instructions. I'm not sure how that occurred but it struck me as a really good sign that it was going to work for him!

One change to this new handomatic for the raptor is that there is no ""pro"" version that takes all 20 measurements. There are only 2 measurement inputs available taken from the user's unaffected hand.

This was initially a concern because my recipient has a much longer hand than usual. The initial palm that the handomatic produced was too short to fit him. At first I wasn't sure what to do since there was no ""pro"" version where I could put in the right measurements for his affected hand. Then I realized I really only needed the two dimension inputs available. I could just change the length measurement from the actual measurements of my recipients hand to a longer measurement.

I increased the length measurement and kicked out a new set of STL files and then imported them into Fusion360 to measure the resulting hand. It was a little too long so I just repeated tweaking the measurement. On my 3rd try I got a perfect fit!

The only thing that concerned me was that when I imported the STL's into ""Slicer"" to print them they gave me an error saying that design wasn't ""manifold"" or ""watertight"". That seems like a problem. I'm not sure if this was issue with handomatic slicer or me.

Does anyone have an idea what went wrong or what I should do?

P.S. The handomatic is brilliant and the folks working on it should get an award of some kind. My hats off to you ladies and gentlemen who have been working so hard to make this software possible!",,,,,,,,

It was great to meet everyone at the e-Nable conference!

I discussed the following concept with Peter and +Peregrine Hawthorn to allow more force to be applied if there's little bending and force in the wrist. I was thinking of using a ratched. So instead of a vague sketch I made at the conference I whipped this op in openSCAD:
https://www.youmagine.com/designs/e-nable-ratchet-force-amp-pulley-concept

Compared to directly pulling the cables this will duplicate the force if you make the same amount of bending movement twice. You can also decide on a 1:3 ratio for 3 times the strength. In any case if you can only bend a little you can do it three times and still grip completely. A release mechanism hasn't been developed yet but that shouldn't be too hard. Also it needs to be tested and the spacings/sizes adjusted. Feel free to continue where I left it because I'll be flying home to my wife and baby!

I was thinking about grip strength last night and it occurred to me that grip strength is just a small part of grip quality. (This stuff is all new to me)

One of the things about the fingers I'd never really thought of before is that the soft tissue plays a big role in grip quality by increasing the surface area of the grip.

When I hold my phone tight the skin/muscle actually conform around the shape and dramatically increase the surface area of the grip and the friction of the grip.

The little silicon finger sleeves that we put over the fingertips help but I'm curious to experiment a bit.

My idea is to build a crude skeletal fingers in fusion360 stick it in a mold and pour one of Smooth-Ons soft durable urethanes into the mold over the finger. I'd want something close to the Durometer of an actual human finger. I'm thinking 3mm thick of urethane would do it.

The best part is I think it should be possible to 3d print the actual mold for the fingers on the same plate as the fingers themselves. It would be pretty cool to be able to print a skeletal finger print the mold shell and then pour a few ounces of 2 part urethane and wind up with a more lifelike human grip. I bet it would only $1 or so to the cost of a hand.

Just a thought but where we use pvc tubing that could be replaced with something like this. Once cut down it could be a set system for any sized recipient a young child or expanded for an adult.

As a child grew he could take it out a notch or like our little friend young Derek who wanted an arm LONGER than his other he could have the option to shorten it back down when it was more convenient

What should our hands be able to do? It's an interesting question. I think the guiding principle to answering that question is ""what will make our hands most useful""? Admittedly what's useful for 1 person will be different from another but considerable thought has been put into creating conceptual frameworks of prosthetic utility.

If you have a framework of prosthetic utility and simple measurable activities that an be performed to measure the utility of the hand you've gotten something fantastic. Now you can evaluate the strengths and weakness of existing designs; and start focusing on how to improve the hand to perform better on the test! If the test is well thought out and aligned to actual daily activities of users you now know exactly what you need to do to make the hand more useful.

Above is another great video posted by Wolf Schweitzer a below elbow amputee. He's put an enormous amount of thought into prosthetic utility. He's produced dozens if not hundreds of videos evaluating each of the commercial prosthesis that he owns with respect to actual utility. He also owns a $100000+ i-limb which he's also reviewed. In the video he's using an Otto Bock hand that's body powered fully mechanical and was designed about 80 years ago that retails for about $1000.

One of the benchmark tests that he does is the ""Carrol Test"" shown in the video above which is a prosthetic utility test designed by renowned prosthetist Kevin Carroll. The Carrol Test is a set of 33 tasks that are intended to evaluate the utility of a prosthetic based on activities representing the different uses of a hand used in daily life.

What I like about this idea is that it provides a conceptual framework against which to judge the utility of the existing and future hand models. I feel like the existing designs are amazing and they keep getting better. The value that I see in evaluating the hands against a fixed set of criteria is that it will highlight the areas most in need of improvement.

Our current hands for example really excel at gripping tubular shaped objects like a briefcase. They would pass the ""clothes iron"" lifting test above with flying colors. On the other hand I don't thing they could pick up the wooden wedge because they lack an adaptive grip. +Steve Wood  has an awesome solution to that problem in his Whipplet Balancing mechanism that is dead simple and super easy to put in our existing hands (5 minutes of print time 5 minutes of installation time). With that addition the Raptor would now pass the ""wedge test"". Picking up the marbles would be much more a challenging for our hands but having this as a goal could guide future designs.

In short the point of benchmarking the hands is to understand what they do well and what they don't do well. Knowing what they should do well but can't is critical to designing better hands.

The great news is that having benchmarked these expensive commercial designs against a fixed set of criteria Wolf Schweitzer came to a surprising conclusion. The $1000 Becker hand and Otto Bock prosthetics handily outperform the $100000 i-limb. That's a pretty surprising outcome but it sounds like great news to me. It makes me wonder if we can reach the same level of utility for $50.

Here's a really interesting paper that gives an overview of the work done on prosthetic utility frameworks from 1970-2009 . It's a bit dry but there are some juicy bits if you find this interesting. It's best feature is the 187 references at the bottom.

The user in the video Wolf Schweitzer has a below the elbow amputation (no hand or wrist). Mr. Schweitzer compares it favorably to the 5 prosthetics he owns and notes that it's superior in most respects to the $100000 i-limb hand that he also owns. It's lighter less fatiguing more comfortable faster more intuitive and dramatically more durable.

The mechanism is purely mechanical and it's 100% body powered. It's activated using a should harness like a an otto-bock hook. As the elbow is straightened the hand opens.

Here is wealth of info on hand including videos of the mechanism.

http://www.swisswuff.ch/tech/?p=228

The most interesting design detail to me is that it is a voluntary opening mechanism meaning that the default position for the hand is closed. The body power is used to open the hand. This is the opposite of our hands which are voluntary closing.

I think the default closed hand is an interesting design with a lot of potential. It would be especially useful for sustained gripping activities like carrying a briefcase riding a bike holding an umbrella canoeing; any activity where a sustained firm grip is necessary.

I'm interesting to adapt this designed from being an ""arm powered"" prosthetic to a wrist powered prosthetic. An important design consideration as pointed out by +Nick Parker   is Hooke's law which holds that the resistance of a spring relates to the square of extension. In short to obtain 1 Newton of grip strength the peak opening force would be as much as 4 Newtons.

Ultimately however I'd prefer to generate 4 Newtons to open the hand and hold an canoe paddle for 1hr with no additional effort than I would to sustain a grip of 1 Newton for 2hrs. It's dramatically more efficient. I think the idea has potential.

I'm curious to try to retrofit a Raptor hand so that it replicates these dynamics. Five elastic tubes would be used to pull the grip closed by default and the user would use the wrist flexion to open it.

The key to using the default closed grip would be to make the resistance adjustable with elastic tubing. There would be 3 settings for grip strength high medium and low. The adjustment would simply be to place 3 hooks at progressively further distances from the hand. Most of the time the lowest setting would be used. To hold a canoe paddle for a few hours the band would be pulled up to the highest setting than hand would open once and the grip would stay closed by the elastic tubes for an hour or a 1000hrs.

The biggest question I have is the obvious one. How could the existing Raptor hand be modified so that the wrist flexion opens the hand rather than closing it?

I just wanted to thank you all for your devotion and support of this effort to help build and develop affordable patient specific hand prosthetics. This group has made giant leaps to produce functional easily printable easily assemble(able) and aesthetically pleasing devices.  

However i have a challenge!!! I think it is very possible to maintain these previously achieved design goals while attempting to better emulate the physiological biomechanics of the hand. There are several aims that can be targeted I'll just talk about one for now. First i would shoot to better appropriate moment distribution of the DIPPIP and MCP joints. In my experience (and correct me if im wrong) the order of activation and the distribution of moments about these joints in the current designs are disproportionate to the normal hand. This is not to be unexpected after all the original design goals were to make functional cheap durable hands that anyone can make. I believe we have achieved those goal and with this pool of talent can do much more than that. Thoughts?

I was searching the internet for alternative examples of prosthetic hands and I came across a really neat one. It was a commercially available hand that had appeared to have a really interesting feature. The full open position of our hands occur when the wrist is straight or parallel with the forearm and closes when the wrist is bent to -90 degrees. This hand achieved full open when the wrist was +90 degrees to the forearm and fully closed when the wrist is straight. The opposite of our hands.

This may sound like a minor change but I think it's significant. The gripping force that we're able to achieve is a function of the force created by wrist flexion in conjunction with the moment arm of the movement. I'm not a physicist so please correct my terrible misuse of terms when I miss the mark. In layman's terms if I apply a fixed force to a wrench and turn it 90 degrees to make a bolt turn 1"" then I can double the force if I use gearing and make a 180 degree turn to make the bolt turn the same 1"".

The way it would apply to the fingers is that rather than using a 90 degree movement of the wrist to go from full open to full close you use the full 180 degree movement of the wrist to go from fully open to fully close. In short the fingers would be straight when wrist was bent +90 degrees and fully closed when it was at -90 degrees.

I think this principle could be used to double the gripping strength of a hand.

What's even more exciting is that when you're carrying something heavy like a briefcase handle in your hand the weight of the object and the vertical force vector forces you're wrist to be straight. Since having your wrist straight in this hand closes the fingers to the 50% closed grip position the actual weight of the object is the force that closes the grip! The same principles apply to pulling on an object like a refrigerator door. That's pretty cool.

This puts the grip strength back into the upper arms and shoulders which can develop significantly more power than the wrist. In this case you could more than double the gripping strength. Watch the video at 1 min and 40 secs to see what I mean.

That's the theory and I think it could work but I'm not a biomechanical engineer by a long shot. What do you guys think?

I'm working with an 11 year recipient in Phoenix Arizona who has four residual fingers 1cm-2cm in length and a thumb. The problem I have run into is that his hand is much longer (as measured from wrist to fingertips) than the 135% scaled palm that fits his wrist diameter.

I have attached the photo of his hand sitting on top of the cyborg beast fitting print-out. The printout was printed with the correct scaling so the printed 2cm marks match 2cm on a ruler so that's not the issue. The bend of his wrist is correctly aligned with the reference mark on the print-out so that's not it either. He just has a big healthy hand! You can see that his hand overlaps the end of the palm printout by about 20mm.

I need to figure out how to lengthen the palm cavity so that his hand will fit but I don't have any 3d design experience whatsoever. It's just way out of my league. Is there anyone who help or that can point me in the right direction?

I'm working on a left hand thumb-less cyborg beast for an 11 year old boy in Phoenix Arizona. I used the ""Tracker"" software and the photos and followed the instructions from wonderful video tutorial Jeremy Simon put together. I then used the Hand-o-Matic on the pro settings with all 20 measurements to generate the STL files.

The gauntlet and the fingers look fine to me but the palm seems totally out of scale. I think this is because of the fact that his hand measurements as measured from wrist to fingertip is quite long compared to the ""average"" case. As I mentioned above he has a full hand and short fingers (17mm). I suspect that this may be tricking the Hand-O-Matic into think that his palm should be very large rather than very long.

I've attached the picture below to show you what I mean. It seems to me that the palm component is too large. I think that the tendon holes should probably be close to co-planer but you can see that the tendon holes on the palm component are much higher than the tendon holes on the gauntlet.

This is my first hand of any kind and I'm a bit of 3d printing novice. I want to build Ethan the best hand possible so I wanted to get some feedback from some veterans on how best to resolve the problem (if indeed there is one!). Does this look right?

To stretch an STL linearly you can use a one-line OpenSCAD script like this:

Install OpenSCAD from http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html . I recommend a development snapshot as it has vastly better performance than the current ""production"" release.

To stretch an STL in OpenSCAD run the GUI and put something like this into the editor:

scale([20.71]) import(""/Users/laird/src/e-NABLE-Assembler/Cyborg_Beast/STL Files/Owens_Hex_Sleeve_7.0.stl"");

Note that you can drop an STL file into OpenSCAD and it will write the import statement with the file's path. This makes imports easy.

The above loads the STL file scales it by 2x in the X axis 0.7x in the Y axis and unchanged (x1) in the Z axis. Use any scaling factor you like.

Hit F6 to compile the design and then File/Export/Export as STL... to export the scaled STL.

So for the GUI it's drop the file into OpenSCAD add the scale function F6 file/export/STL.

To run this from a command line create a one-line OpenSCAD file named 'scale.scad' with contents:

scale(scaleFactor) import(name);

And then run it from a command line like:

openscad -o result.stl -D scaleFactor=[20.71] -D name = ""/Users/laird/src/e-NABLE-Assembler/Cyborg_Beast/STL Files/Owens_Hex_Sleeve_7.0.stl"" scale.scad

Which assigns the values from the command line to scaleFactor and name and runs the script and saves the result as an STL file named result.stl.

So you can now use that simple command line command to scale any STL by X/Y/Z factors as desired. Useful for integrating into automated workflows.

More details are at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Using_OpenSCAD_in_a_command_line_environment .

 Silica Aerogel Infused Filament for 3D printers

Fellow Makers Inventors and Innovators; My name is Daniel P. Lynge and I am the Chief Science Officer and Head Alchemist for Angstrom Innovations Inc.

Angstrom Innovations is a small Advanced Materials manufacturer based near Seattle specializing in Hydrophobic Silica Aerogel particulates (Extreme Thermal & Electrical Insulator). What has that got to do with 3D-printing? Well one of my hobbies is 3D modeling and printing. I’ve tinkered with stuff since I can remember (like the time I got in trouble for disassembling all the telephones in the house… I was 6) and got the Idea to combine the two while watching a “How do they make that?” episode featuring peanut butter filled chocolates with my son…

You all are my type of folk at least as far as being makers and tinkerers hackers & inventors. I really^3 want to see what you creative types can make with an Aerogel infused 3D-printer filament. I’ve combined some 200~200 mesh particulates with ABS and mechanical/destructive testing suggests an upper limit to the Aerogel to ABS ratio. I’ve seen carbon nanotube- & buckyball- steel- aluminum- and other material -Infused Filaments in ABS & PLA for the 3D-printer market and so I asked the Angstrom Beancounters they said “Get positive feedback by noon Tuesday or it’s a NO-GO”.

So Can I get “Peer Review” for the concept of Silica Aerogel infused 3D-Printer Filament? Would this be a Useful Thing? I know I’m excited about it but it’s my idea; that and $5 will get you a Mocha. As far as insulative objects made with an additive printer do you like the idea? Would you like to have Aerogel Infused Thermoplastic Filaments? And what would you be willing to pay for a 1 lb. spool equivalent of A.I. Filament?

Thank you for your Time and hopefully your support.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LairdPopkin/posts/H3E75enBmgW,"I printed ABS and NinjaFlex together as a single dual extruder print and it worked quite well. The two bonded well making the joint a single print. Which means we can come closer to a 'print in place' hand. 

I also tried PLA with NinjaFlex with less success. The NinjaFlex printed into the PLA but the PLA didn't print onto NinjaFlex. That's the 'blue' photo.

Should be interesting to apply to a complete hand design!

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+PeregrineHawthorn/posts/YG5JYbqGgP6,"So I just got my new Cyborg Beast from +Jen Owen today and this is VERY interesting. There are a lot of differences I didn't expect at all.

By far the biggest difference is the fit. The Talon focuses on keeping a good fit on my paw with a relatively loose and flexible hold on my forearm. This is the exact opposite with a very strong grip on my forearm particularly on the underside closest to the elbow and on the top closer to the wrist but my paw just sits in the palm loose until I use the fingers. This feels really nice for my paw but I feel like it would be rough on my arm. I can't help but feel that the shifting bones when I rotate my arm would put pressure in bad places maybe pinching nerves. I think that's mostly from the high almost pointy arch that the bracer makes. It pushes in on the side but my arm rarely makes any significant contact with the top before the sides of my arm are already uncomfortably tight against the center of the 'hourglass' shape. 

As for grip strength I'm enjoying the cables that can take tight corners easily and the rigidity of the design. My wrist correlates EXACTLY with the finger movements. The only issue I have with it is that a lot of finger movement correlates with only a little wrist movement. It doesn't take much force to pry something out of my grip. 

I rather like the tensioning system used. I've got no fault with it though I haven't tried to adjust it yet.

Another thing of note is that when fully extended the back of the top of the hand bumps into the top of the bracer in a way that prevents any chance of pinching skin which is nice.

I haven't used it hard enough to break anything yet but I'll let everyone know as soon as I do.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+ClariceTorrey/posts/P2FXJp6o4yh,"Hi I'm a pediatric occupational therapist. I attended the meeting last week in SF. There was a moment (or two) that we got off the intended topic. One of those times we touched on the functionality of the prosthesis. +Jorge Zuniga mentioned there were several psychological benefits of having the device beyond the ability to actually grasp things which of course I think is great. But as an OT I have to think about function. I wanted to give you a small insight into my experience of working with people who can only use one upper extremity and think about some functional tasks we could think about when designing the hand.

First off let me say that you can live a completely independent life with the use of only one UE. The kids I work with who have prostheses that don't function well will not use them. They will figure out a way to do things with one hand. In my opinion if you want a kid to use the prosthesis you have to make it worth their effort. It is highly unlikely that they will need to pick up something tiny on a table with their prosthesis they are just going to use their fully functioning hand. 
Tasks that are made easier with two hands: zipping up a jacket cutting with a fork and knife opening/closing a baggy opening a jar doing dishes... etc.

Think about the grasp patterns that are needed for some of those activities. Zipping a jacket needs a pretty powerful lateral pinch holding a fork to cut with a knife needs a stable gross grasp etc. 
Most bilateral activities the ""helper hand"" is used for stability not manipulation.

I'm sure that someone with an upper extremity reduction can speak to this even better so please feel free to add to these thoughts.",,,,,,,,

These designs do NOT have to be based on Hands only. Some of the themes that represent e-nable: Global Village The Future is in our hands The community/helping make the world a better place etc etc - get creative and really think about what e-NABLE is and has come to represent. (we really are about more than hands!)

Things I am looking for:

1. ALL designs MUST BE VECTOR GRAPHICS. Preferably designs that can be created in 1-2 colors maximum to keep costs down on shirts and that will work well on a variety of t-shirt colors.

2. Something specific for children's shirts - maybe a comic book style character with a cool Super hero/Cyborg hand. If you can manage to make something that is gender neutral - that would be fabulous!

3. My favorite quote that really seems to define us: ""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world; indeed it's the only thing that ever has."" Margaret Mead  - create something around that quote that will work for a shirt and I'll love you forever. :)

4. Something for the tech minded/design minded folks. Something creative that they would actually wear as a shirt. :)

5. All tshirts must have our website URL in it somewhere - www.enablingthefuture.org 

If you have a design that you would like to submit for consideration for a t-shirt - please email it to me at enablehands@gmail.com and please put ""Shirt Design"" in the subject line!

We will be adding more and more designs to our store once we get it up and going so we will have a variety of shirts to choose from. :) So please feel free to submit more than one!

If your shirt design gets chosen this time around - you get a free tshirt and all proceeds from sales go toward our newly formed Enable Community Foundation that will help us to continue to provide hands for free to those that need them!

Also present were David's uncle William Sullivan and friend e-NABLEr +Skip Meetze  both formerly from Xerox and now big fans of e-NABLE  and +Jade Myers .  A good time was had by all.


There are improvements to be made in the arm:  but Derek and his mom thought his was good enough to go!  He wore it home.

Here are a few things we learned:
* a rotating wrist is cool and apparently innovative  (pronation and supernation) 
* elbow actuation can require minimal bending of the arm (we have a new mechanism to increase the leverage)
* aligning the elbow hinge with the elbow joint is important (we're working on an adustable hinge mechanism)
* an across-the-back harness to keep the arm in place is probaby a good idea
* casting with alginate and plaster of paris is easy fun and satisfying
* padding and silicone sleeves need further research
* the gauntlets and socket cups need to use as much length as possible...but mustn't impinge on armpits or elbow pits.
* it's important to make sure you put a Left Hand on a Left Arm!

I rushed the print to make a meeting this weekend so it is not a high quality print but it is enough to get the gist of it.  Incorrect hardware aside it came together pretty well.

In order to get good smooth motion I added some 0.010"" brass shims in the joints to keep the plastic from rubbing.  Really cleaned up the motion quite a bit.

Any pointers on getting the elastic dialed in? I tied them to a short piece of filament and created a channel in the hand so the filament sits flush.  To adjust I just added wraps around the filament and tied a knot. My first attempt was to tie them in pairs but this didn't allow for individual adjustment of each finger and was very difficult to adjust.  I am only moderately happy with where I ended up.  Maybe I have the wrong elastic but trying to get enough tension to pull the finger up to horizontal AND not require too much force to close was not achievable.  They sag a bit when the hand is held horizontal.  Is this normal?

I have recently found about your group and believe in your fantastic mission.  I am an experienced Mechanical Design Engineer and have been modeling in SolidWorks for many years.  I have both design and fabrication skills I would love to share.  

I joined your group yesterday added myself to the map and downloaded the files for a Cyborg Beast for a first print.  I have been printing mainly in PLA but broke into a roll of Taulman Bridge Nylon yesterday to build a Cyborg Beast simply for proof of process.  I managed to spit out a couple fingers but I still have some to learn about the intricacies of printing with Nylon.

While attempting to slice the parts I found many errors in the STL files and difficult geometry.  As a result I spent the day creating a parametric SolidWorks model of the Cyborg Finger.  I reworked the parts only as a demonstration of one way I may be able contribute. Attached is a graphic of the original and  new model for the finger and thumbs.  

Please let me know if / how I can be of assistance.

I am trying to complete the Cyborg Beast in order to be an approved printer. I printed it at 125% scale however the chicago screws from the online kit (http://shop3duniverse.com/products/e-nable-hand-assembly-materials-kit-cyborg-beast-edition) are much too large for the printed parts. I tried drilling to widen up the holes a bit but they were still too tight. Further drilling with larger bit just results in cracked plastic. Is the online kit made for only larger scaling factors? Is lots of drilling always required for hand assembly? I am using the Makerbot Replicator 2X set on high resolution with ABS filament.

2. Pads on the corners and little bits (see the pictures).
3. Dry filament.  Put that stuff in the oven or if you have it a food dehydrator and really get the water out.

The main reasons parts don't stick are corners and peninsulas. These two features only matter on layer one.  Put a 12 mm pad of the same thickness as your layer height (you only want this on the first layer) on each feature and it will act as a suction cup.  Believe it or not.

The reason brim doesn't work well is that the brim as implemented in all slicers simply follows the contour of the part.  In other words the brim IS a corner/peninsula.  For this we sacrifice speed (time) and all kinds of remedies to get that thing to print.

If any designers out there would like to discuss this further just drop me a line or pick up on this post.

Good prints to all!

My filament supply is running low so I've decided it's finally time to make the switch from 3mm to 1.75mm and am looking to buy something to handle all the flexible filaments and fancy nylons I throw at it.",,,,,,,,

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AndreasBastian/posts/Q8fPAHXkWTX,I 'm helping with this year's Make Magazine 3D printer shootout and wanted to poll the community for questions they'd like to have answered about popular 3D printers.  It's going to be a short weekend spent testing the machines so we may not be able to hit everything but it would be great to hear from people who are looking to get into 3D printing.  I'm especially interested to hear from people who haven't used 3D printers before.,,,,,,,,
https://plus.google.com/u/0/+FrankieFlood/posts/8XpiqtdYhHa,"I thought I would post some pics of the mold making process that my team of students is experimenting with. I had noticed that +Nick Parker is getting ready to make molds for some finger parts and I realize that he will most likely 3D print his molds but regardless I thought our processes might be helpful to others. The molds are being made to cast parts at a specific scale but when or if we make multiple hands at a specific scale this will be useful. We can make molds for one two or even three different scale hands and then easily and rapidly create hand components. My team usually makes at least two hands for each child that we create hands for (so they have a ""back-up hand"") and this will allow us to make molds for whatever scale hand we happen to make a hand for. Soon we can build a library of molds that we can use when we get requests and we can pull those molds and cast parts from these to save on time. Alternatively we can cast base hand models to experiment with and stress test with less of a time investment in the printing time. Printer upkeep and use goes down due to the number of hands we are printing.

In this case I used my son's legos to build mold boxes. This allows for irregular shaped molds and conserves on mold making materials which can be expensive. The mold box is built and the bottom of the box is lined with clay at the thickness that you want your mold half to be. It should be thick enough to hold it's shape as a final mold half without needing a mother mold surround (usually at least 1/2"" thick in this particular Smooth-On Rio Flex material). The printed part is imbedded half way into the clay dimples are placed in the clay to act as ""keys"" for the mold halves to align properly and then everything is sprayed with mold release. The RioFlex parts are mixed and then poured into the mold. The mold material solidifies and then it is flipped over clay removed and a small sprue or cylinder is added to the printed part as a future ""pour spout"". The other half of the mold sprayed with mold release. The RioFlex parts are mixed and poured for the other half of the mold. Once this solidifies the original printed part can be removed by pulling the two mold halves apart and your'e ready to mix plastic and pour the part. The ""sprue"" can be trimmed from the part and now you can put your part into use.

For complex parts with internal passage ways we plan on using metal rods or wire as ""core Pins"" that are cast in place inside the passage ways of the printed parts. these core pins extend outside the passageways and into the mold. Each time the mold is poured with plastic the core pins are put into place inside the mold halves and later pulled out of the cast part leaving an open passageway.

I know this diverts from the 3D printing focus of what we are doing (in some ways) but I have to ask myself what the next step is in providing hands for people in need. This is something that we're exploring here in the DCRL and we'll keep posted on our progress.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+CameronONeill/posts/6dnXFAFHbCe,"Food for thought:
What if some of the popular hand/arm designs had a ""standard"" that made it really easy to completely customize hands with the desired tensioner fingers palm etc. without having to modify the 3d files at all (excluding scaling.)  From the tests I've done it's already really easy to use different people's designs together without making changes in many cases but imagine what it would be like to have an ""e-Nable customizer"" where users could actually mix and match the different components and using the right sized hardware just assemble everything without trouble.
The biggest problem with this is that unless every design is parametric scaling a finger to the appropriate size for instance is going to change the size of any bearings bolts and cabling you're using.  
Just a thought.",,,,,,,,

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AndreasBastian/posts/52eVxAsYpZG,"+Peter Binkley's  post earlier today about designing gauntlets to print without support is a great example of how we can increase the accessibility of these devices through design.  It is entirely possible to design these devices to not require generated support material.  It's very time consuming to remove support material and it often leaves a rough surface with sharp edges.   As somebody who has run 3D printers everyday for two years I almost never print designs that require generated support because of the additional hassle.  I think we can remove that impediment to printing by removing the need for generated support material.

On that note I first posted about thermoforming in October and have always meant to update my old gauntlet design.  I finally had some time last week to put together an updated version that is Cyborg Beast compatible.  I am cleaning up its parametric source file (designed in Fusion) this weekend to share.  The photos include an earlier version without a tensioner-- once I get my demo Cyborg Beast Hand back I'll try out the tensioning system.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+CameronONeill/posts/aKoDjGZ2Yj5,While I'm waiting on some hardware for +David Holmes hand I completely redesigned the forearm component.  I mentioned the idea of this design awhile ago.  Rather than using one solid piece this is a 5-part wrist brace and tensioner that can be printed on small printers without any support material.  I found this to be very important because a large portion of the 3d printing community is using printers like the printrbot simple and they have small build areas.  The idea here is that one long non-stretchy string runs through all the small holes on the side of each flat piece connecting them together.  The string would be loosened/tightened according to the size of the users wrist/forearm.  It would still be lined with foam and attach with velcro straps.  If this design works as intended it could print faster and more efficiently than some of the other common models now.  It's also less prone to breakage because the string connections give it some flexibility.  My only concern is that the bit of flexibility could throw off the tensioner's ability to do its job.  Currently the design is also made with the intention of putting some 7mm OD ball bearings on the wrist swivel.  Any thoughts?,,,,,,,,

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+CameronONeill/posts/EbRjbL9kJqL,As far as finger joints go has anybody used bushings on thin metal rod rather than just the rod or ball bearings?  Ball bearings seem fairly heavy and pins are much more prone to wear.  With bushings it seems like you'd get the best of both worlds. Press fit bushings should also be cheaper than chicago bolts or bearings.,,,,,,,,
