What should our hands be able to do? It's an interesting question. I think the guiding principle to answering that question is ""what will make our hands most useful""? Admittedly, what's useful for 1 person will be different from another, but considerable thought has been put into creating conceptual frameworks of prosthetic utility.

If you have a framework of prosthetic utility, and simple measurable activities that an be performed to measure the utility of the hand you've gotten something fantastic. Now you can evaluate the strengths and weakness of existing designs; and start focusing on how to improve the hand to perform better on the test! If the test is well thought out, and aligned to actual daily activities of users, you now know exactly what you need to do to make the hand more useful.

Above is another great video posted by Wolf Schweitzer, a below elbow amputee. He's put an enormous amount of thought into prosthetic utility. He's produced dozens if not hundreds of videos evaluating each of the commercial prosthesis that he owns with respect to actual utility. He also owns a $100,000+ i-limb, which he's also reviewed. In the video he's using an Otto Bock hand that's body powered, fully mechanical, and was designed about 80 years ago that retails for about $1000.

One of the benchmark tests that he does is the ""Carrol Test"", shown in the video above, which is a prosthetic utility test designed by renowned prosthetist Kevin Carroll. The Carrol Test is a set of 33 tasks that are intended to evaluate the utility of a prosthetic based on activities representing the different uses of a hand used in daily life.

What I like about this idea is that it provides a conceptual framework against which to judge the utility of the existing and future hand models. I feel like the existing designs are amazing, and they keep getting better. The value that I see in evaluating the hands against a fixed set of criteria, is that it will highlight the areas most in need of improvement.

Our current hands for example really excel at gripping tubular shaped objects like a briefcase. They would pass the ""clothes iron"" lifting test above with flying colors. On the other hand, I don't thing they could pick up the wooden wedge, because they lack an adaptive grip. +Steve Wood  has an awesome solution to that problem in his Whipplet Balancing mechanism that is dead simple, and super easy to put in our existing hands (5 minutes of print time, 5 minutes of installation time). With that addition, the Raptor would now pass the ""wedge test"". Picking up the marbles would be much more a challenging for our hands, but having this as a goal could guide future designs.

In short, the point of benchmarking the hands, is to understand what they do well, and what they don't do well. Knowing what they should do well, but can't, is critical to designing better hands.

The great news is that having benchmarked these expensive commercial designs against a fixed set of criteria Wolf Schweitzer came to a surprising conclusion. The $1,000 Becker hand and Otto Bock prosthetics handily outperform the $100,000 i-limb. That's a pretty surprising outcome, but it sounds like great news to me. It makes me wonder if we can reach the same level of utility for $50.

Here's a really interesting paper that gives an overview of the work done on prosthetic utility frameworks from 1970-2009 . It's a bit dry, but there are some juicy bits if you find this interesting. It's best feature is the 187 references at the bottom.

I have a recipient who is 31 years old who underwent a R) arm amputation about 3 months ago due to loss of blood supply following a burn contracture release. The amputation is through the elbow, he has a small portion of his arm below the elbow left (about 2cm) but this is not really a functional joint at this point because it is so small, so we are treating it as a through elbow amputation at this stage. 
The patient is a farmer. He must lift and carry heavy buckets and baskets of all sizes, work cranks and machinery, sort and stack corn. Many things that he carries are heavy, and he must be able to hold plants while chopping with a machete. He also has a motorcycle that he needs to drive, but that requires rotation of both wrists (which we understand will be unlikely in a basic prosthetic). Mostly we expect he will use his L) hand for most things and use the R) arm as a support. 
I have attached pictures of the stump.

Please let me know if you have any advice. Also, what design is beneficial for him. Any information will greatly be appreciated.

So i've been thinking of a way to incorporate powered options into our standard designs but by making as little as possible changes to the designs. This is so that volunteers familiar with the standard Raptor, Cyborg beast or Flexihand can easily work with a powered option as well, and to ensure that powered options stay in the loop with future iterations to the standard designs. With that in mind, refer to my pictures below (sorry if the quality is bad, I should just get a new phone and get it over with). Currently I have thought of two options:

Option 1: Fix one or two servos (number depending on torque rating and requirement) to the gauntlet. The bodies will be stationary with regards to the gauntlet, while the palm should be fixed to the servo shafts. This way, when the servo shafts turn, the palm will rotate and the fingers will close. This basically replaces a person's wrist action directly.Just brackets to attach the servos to the gauntlet and the shafts to the palm will be needed - small changes.

Option 2: Translate the circular motion of the servo shaft into a linear motion of the tensioner, by connecting the two via a cable and winding this cable onto the servo shaft. The wires then pulls the whole tensioner bracket with all the strings towards the arm, thereby causing the fingers to close. For this to work, the connection between the palm and the gauntlet (currently pivoting) will have to be fixed. A bracket for the servo/s, a rotary-to-linear translation system (sounds more complicated than it is) and fixed connections will be necessary - a few more changes than option 1 but still not much.

Im leaning towards option1 because of the following:
- direct drive solution, no degrees of freedom in between the shaft and the actual movement.
- less design changes

But this is just the way I think. I would like and appreciate some input on this before i go ahead with the next phase. Please feel free to join the effort if you are intrigued. +Monika Jones +Nick Parker +Roberto Baccarini +Mike Trieu +Ed Greig +more people :)

I know that this group is devoted to helping people needing prostheses, but I hope you will take some time to read this post and provide suggestions. 

I am a veterinarian with a patient that has right forelimb paresis due to be hitting by a car and suffering permanent nerve damage. He is having a hard time keeping up on walks and playing with his family. I saw a youtube video about a dog named Derby who was born with bilateral forelimb paresis, and the result is similar to that of my patient Toby, except Toby is one sided. I thought that the prosthesis made for Derby would work well for Toby. After attempting to contact 3d systems several times, and receiving no response, I am seeking help, advice, assistance on helping Toby here. As a disclaimer the family cannot afford the conventional pvc pipe based carts, etc. and there is no profit motive in this. I will not be charging them for this. I am more interested in getting involved in this area of work, and perhaps one day being able to contribute to the work being done here.

Anyway, sorry for the long post, but looking for any advice, help, mentoring, etc. on this, how to get started? what equipment do I need, can I ""virutally"" borrow a 3d printer? What materials would be best suited for this application, etc. . .

I have access to an amazing makerspace community in the city that is government subsidized, where I have been doing a lot of 3D printing, along with CNC machining, etc. called AssentWorks. There are  4 functional FDM 3D printers there at the moment, as well as a few others being unboxed in the coming weeks, so there is a lot of potential for high volume printing at this one space, currently.

At the moment, how are we scaling the STL files to different limb sizes? I may have a very quick and easy digital solution, much more affordable than 3D scanners, if we are currently doing this with hand measurement.

This is an amazing venture. Very excited to get involved and work with all of you.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Grip strength is really important. The grip strength of existing hands needs to be improved, but that's difficult to do if there isn't a way to even measure what the grip strength is!  Here is one approach.

A cheap spring scale is used to measure the input force. A cheap food scale is placed in the palm, and the fingers are closed on it with a fixed force exerted against the tendon lines (which are attached to the spring scale) to measure how much grip strength is produced given that fixed input force.

I'm going to put the scale in the palm of a v1 Raptor hand and take a measurement using 10lb of input force using my grip efficacy testing rig, a full description of which can be found here:

I envision measuring just the 4 fingers with the first measurement, and then the thumb-forefinger pinch grip with the second measurement. Since I don't actually have a hand with a thumb, or a 3d printer, the pinch grip measurement will take a while! :)

Ideally, it will be possible to measure the grip strength throughout the range of motion of the grip. I'd like to measure it with the fingers fully opened, 25% closed, 50% closed, 75% closed, and 100% closed.

I have a half baked idea of how to design a rotating holder for the scale so that I can measure the finger force at different rates of closure, but it will take me ages to get to that project. I'll stick to just measuring gripping force with the fingers fully closed by just placing the scale in the palm.

My main objective is just to get folks thinking about cheap, reliable ways to measure grip strength, so that we can assess whether we're making progress on this critical metric of hand utility. If you've got another idea of how to do this, or can find a better scale, be sure to post.

There are many other ways, but this one picture illustrates two or three different paths that share one cool idea.

1. Field person (M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, Peace Corps, ICRC, a parent) takes measurements and pictures to upload.

2. Worldwide Aggregator (may need a person to augment the automated software in some cases) generates request package and dispatches to a pipeline, maybe one of several pipelines, or maybe more than one.  Could also be replicated by region to minimize shipping or warehouse 'Shoe Store' inventory.

3. A corporate Pipeline Host (who also sells filament) shows pairs of A & B pictures:  A needed a hand, B printed it! followed by a list of not yet printed requests: A needs a hand printed, B could be YOU?

4. Fabricator (B) signs up on that pipeline to print a hand

5. Fabricator sends/delivers it directly to the Field Person (5a) or back to the Worldwide Aggregator (5b) who does some sort of Quality Control check before sending it on to the Field Person.

6. After verification of success by the Worldwide Aggregator (maybe), Pipeline Host is notified to send a discounted spool of filament to Fabricator to thank them and encourage them to do it again for another request in the pipeline.

Variations:

The Fieldperson in 1 could use the Hand-o-matic, print the hand, and deliver it, as is common today.  But we could make it easy to cycle through the hosted pipeline of their choice in order to earn a discounted spool of filament from the pipeline host.

We talked about modification of one of the existing designs for enhanced functionality (our conversation focused on the Cyborg Beast, but others may work fine as well).

Through our discussion, David proposed two possible changes to the Cyborg Beast, which would result in additional functionality for an already great design.

1) Change the tensioner design so that bending the wrist down or up will cause the fingers to grasp. The downward bend would be used more for delicate maneuvers, while the upward bend would be more of a strength grasp. This way, when using the stronger grasp, for example when lifting a heavier object, the wrist would be in a better position to reduce risks of carpal tunnel syndrome.

2) Add a rotator ‚Äúcuff‚Äù at the back of the gauntlet which, when turned, would cause the thumb rotation to be adjusted. This would allow the user to easily switch between various grasp types, while still using a mechanical design without electronic components.

A third change was also discussed, having to do with optimal resting position, but that was just because I didn't have the cables on my demo Cyborg Beast tuned quite tightly enough.

The two modifications above seem achievable, and even to my comparitively uneducated mind, it does seem like it would improve the range of things that could be done with the device.

+David Dietz, I did my best to sum up what I understood, but please jump in and provide any clarifications you can.

I could handle the project management role, or I'd be happy to hand it off if anyone else who wants to take it on. It would be the same deal - everyone's welcome to contribute in any way they like...

+Jason Bryant  +Drew Murray   +Peter Binkley  +Jeremy Simon 
When I joined e-NABLE about a year ago, +Alex Thomas +Nicholas Hall  +Bob Roth  and +Skip Meetze 
 were exploring Bowden cables as an alternative to using elastics, and whippletrees were being explored as a path to adaptive grip.  Recently, the Osprey and Phoenix designs have evolved.  Among their incremental improvements are a hand with no elastics and a hand with an adaptive grip.  Why didn't both hands have no elastics and adaptive grip?  

No elastics and adaptive grip seem to be obvious advantages.  In the earlier work, it appears that most, if not all, of the exploration focused on one element for both extension and retraction of the fingers. Did anyone consider or attempt the following:
Closing the fingers depends on fishing line threaded through tubing, or perhaps tubing within tubing which bridges the opening between the bracer and hand. The threads run from a whippletree variation on the rear of the bracer, forward through guides in the bracer, and into tubing which extends perhaps 20mm into the bracer (for a 100% hand). The guides in the bracer are large enough to accommodate the line, but act as a stop to prevent the tubing from being pressed toward the back of the bracer and enable the straightening the fingers.  The (inner) tubing and line then run to the fingertips, where the line is tied off.  When the user raises his hand, the tubing presses against the tie-off in the fingertips and opens the fingers. 
In other words, the retraction of the fingers is conventional Cyborg/Raptor with the addition of a whippletree.  The extension of the fingers is a variation on the Osprey hand.  

Since I don't think in 'stl' files like some of you apparently do, I'll pass on pursuing the idea if it has been previously explored and shown not to work.  If you think the idea has merit, but choose not to pursue it, I'll have a go at altering an existing design to test.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

https://plus.google.com/u/0/110736851786370579318/posts/d1dmYXPrfAF,"The Becker Lock Grip Hand is a really cool prosthetic. This hand was patented in 1938! It's been in continuous production for 78 years with little change.

The user in the video, Wolf Schweitzer, has a below the elbow amputation (no hand or wrist). Mr. Schweitzer, compares it favorably to the 5 prosthetics he owns, and notes that it's superior in most respects to the $100,000 i-limb hand that he also owns. It's lighter, less fatiguing, more comfortable, faster, more intuitive, and dramatically more durable.

The mechanism is purely mechanical, and it's 100% body powered. It's activated using a should harness, like a an otto-bock hook. As the elbow is straightened, the hand opens.

Here is wealth of info on hand, including videos of the mechanism.

http://www.swisswuff.ch/tech/?p=228

The most interesting design detail to me is that it is a voluntary opening mechanism, meaning that the default position for the hand is closed. The body power is used to open the hand. This is the opposite of our hands, which are voluntary closing.

I think the default closed hand is an interesting design with a lot of potential. It would be especially useful for sustained gripping activities like carrying a briefcase, riding a bike, holding an umbrella, canoeing; any activity where a sustained, firm grip is necessary.

I'm interesting to adapt this designed from being an ""arm powered"" prosthetic to a wrist powered prosthetic. An important design consideration, as pointed out by +Nick Parker  , is Hooke's law which holds that the resistance of a spring relates to the square of extension. In short to obtain 1 Newton of grip strength, the peak opening force would be as much as 4 Newtons.

Ultimately however, I'd prefer to generate 4 Newtons to open the hand, and hold an canoe paddle for 1hr with no additional effort, than I would to sustain a grip of 1 Newton for 2hrs. It's dramatically more efficient. I think the idea has potential.

I'm curious to try to retrofit a Raptor hand so that it replicates these dynamics. Five elastic tubes would be used to pull the grip closed by default, and the user would use the wrist flexion to open it.

The key to using the default closed grip would be to make the resistance adjustable with elastic tubing. There would be 3 settings for grip strength, high, medium, and low. The adjustment would simply be to place 3 hooks at progressively further distances from the hand. Most of the time, the lowest setting would be used. To hold a canoe paddle for a few hours, the band would be pulled up to the highest setting, than hand would open once, and the grip would stay closed by the elastic tubes for an hour, or a 1000hrs.

The biggest question I have is the obvious one. How could the existing Raptor hand be modified so that the wrist flexion opens the hand, rather than closing it?

In assembling several Cyborg Beasts, I came across a couple of opportunities for improvement. First, using knots at the end of the non-flexible cords would sometimes result in the knot slipping through the hole, even after tying multiple knots. Second, I noticed that the non-flexible cord recommended in the instructions started to fray at the places where it rubs against plastic parts while moving.

To solve these issues, I found some nice 100lb test fishing line on Amazon which I use for the non-flexible tendons. And I tie each one off to a small bead that fits into the fingertip - much more secure than using a knot.

I've been an Electronics Engineer, specialising in Embedded Control for the last 25 or so years but I found that, despite bing a Husband and Father, a working life involved solely with inanimate objects had made me distant from the rest of humanity and last year I changed my career direction so that I could reconnect with people. Now I run a business in 3D scanning, 3D printing and 3D interactive online content. It's called Pot8oSh3D ( Potatoshed ).

Recently, on a visit to my local MakerSpace - CreateSpace in Wembley - I was asked to assist in the development of a facia to fit a pair of prosthetic legs for Derek; a man who's lower legs were amputated quite recently due to gangrene. I leapt at the chance and Dave ( the project instigator ) and I have burned plenty of midnight oil, solving problems, teasing out issues and printing up prototypes. There'll be plenty more late nights before we have a fully working product but I still have time for other, more pressing projects.

Which brings me to e-NABLE. I tracked down Steve Wood; The designer of the Flexy Hand, when I needed some information to help with the legs. Steve put me on to e-NABLE and the rest, as they say, is history. :-)

I have two 3D printers and three 3D scanners. They're not utilised 100% by any means and I'd be only too pleased to help out any projects with e-NABLE members. I'm pretty handy ( Ohh dear! ) as my hobbies have all involved working on complex mechanisms and I'm resourceful too. Throw me a challenge and see what I come up with!

All the best!

Compared to directly pulling the cables, this will duplicate the force if you make the same amount of bending movement twice. You can also decide on a 1:3 ratio for 3 times the strength. In any case, if you can only bend a little, you can do it three times and still grip completely. A release mechanism hasn't been developed yet, but that shouldn't be too hard. Also, it needs to be tested and the spacings/sizes adjusted. Feel free to continue where I left it because I'll be flying home to my wife and baby!

This would be great stuff for tensioning cables on hands. It's 1.7mm which is about the same as the nylon lift cord, and 4 times as thick as the dyneema fishing line in the hardware sources on the website. The dyneema always struck me as too thin, it seems like it easily break or cut through the thin tie-offs on the tip of the Raptor finger. I like that this stuff is thick enough to distribute the load across a wider area.

The 400# rating is overkill of course, but at 30 feet for $12.99 with free shipping (if you have Amazon Prime) seems like a good deal. You can get 100ft of white nylon lift cord, but 100ft is way more than you could hope to use in a year; I also don't love the white color.

The first testing tool that I designed attempted to measure the mechanical efficiency of a hand, by generating a fixed force on the hand's tendons, and measuring the grip force that was generated.

This second tool attempts to measure something very different. It's an attempt to measure how efficient grip configurations are at actually holding an object.

I'll give you an example to illustrate why this second test is important, and how it works.

Let's imagine that we have 2 hands that we want to test. The first hand is a mechanical marvel. It has sintered bronze bearings in all the joints, teflon coated tendon tubes, kevlar tendons, and bowden tubes in lieu of elastics. It's 100% efficient due to all of these expensive upgrades such that it can translate 1kg of wrist flexion force into exactly 1kg of gripping force at the fingers. But it has hard, slick ABS in all gripping surfaces.

The second hand is just a standard Raptor hand with plastic snap pins, elastics, and poorly sanded joints. It's only 20% efficienct (1kg of wrist flexion force generates 200grams of finger grip force. But it has thick, soft, conforming, high friction rubber on all gripping surfaces.

Now let's imagine you want to see which one can actually grip objects better in the real world. To do this, you take a 1"" diameter chrome cylinder 8"" in length. From this tube, you suspend an empty bucket. You use a simple tensioning screw to generate a fixed force of exactly 1kg of force, measured by a spring scale to simulate 1kg of wrist flexion. You then place the chrome cylinder in the grip of the hand. Now you start pouring 1 liter of water in the bucket at a slow, fixed rate.

Which hand will fail first and drop the bucket? My guess is that the mechanical marvel can't hold the empty bucket. I'd also bet that the Raptor with the grippy, high friction rubber on all gripping surfaces can hold the cylinder even with a full liter of water poured into the bucket.

That's basically what this testing rig does. It's purpose is to help us to understand how different grip configurations affect the actual grip strength in the real world. Maybe high friction rubber makes a huge difference. Maybe adding a 3rd phalange makes it worse. Maybe a molded Oogoo palm with 4 raised bumps that mate with the fingers works like magic. We'll never know until we test different gripping configurations with precise force inputs, a consistent gripped object, and known weights.

You can vary the test by changing the grip input force to 2kg by turning the tensioning screw more. I'd like to test hands in 1kg increments from 1kg - 10kg to see how varying the wrist flexion force affects the amount of weight each grip configuration can hold.

You can also vary the object being gripped. Instead of the chrome cylinder, you might try a square, or an oval, or a rubber ducky.

The reason I designed this test is that I think we need to start engineering friction more effectively. We need to reduce bad friction in the joints, and increase good friction in the gripping surfaces. We can't do much to increase the amount of force our recipients can generate with their wrists, but we can do an awful lot to increase the effectiveness of their grips by reducing bad friction, and increasing good friction.

At any rate, that's what I came up with. I'd love to hear your thoughts on how the test can be improved, what test would be better, or whether or not the test is even useful :)

Methodology: I started by printing some PLA ""sticks."" They're long boxes made about the same width and thickness of the bottom rail of a Raptor gauntlet at 100%. I dipped the sticks in boiling water for varying amounts of time. Then I placed them between two chairs with a bucket hanging from them. I slowly filled the bucket with water. When the sticks broke, I recorded how much water was used. Since 1 ml = 1 gram, This was an easy way to roughly measure the weight needed to break a stick. My measurements weren't terribly exact, but they made a decent approximation for a first test.

Results: Boiling seems to weaken the parts, not strengthen them. My measurements were not as accurate as I'd like, but it's hard to look at the results and believe that another test would give better results.

However, I'd still like another test, if someone else is up to it. Perhaps someone with an accurate scale, unlike me. Science isn't really science until someone can replicate your results.

Breaking Weights:
PLA normal - 6.55kg
PLA 10 sec in boiling water - 6.5kg
PLA 20 sec in boiling water - 6.1kg

Stick dimensions:
4.5x100x6mm

Print settings:
35% infill
.20mm
2 shells

Process:
The ends of the stick are placed on two separate surfaces, spanning them like a bridge. A bucket is hung on the middle of the stick. Water is added to the bucket until the stick breaks. Then the water is weighed.

Note:
The last time I did this test, I placed the plastic stick between two chairs. Halfway through it I realized that if a chair moved even a little bit, then there would be a different gap between the supports, changing the leverage, changing the results. To avoid that I made a fixed arch to put the sticks on. This way there is the same amount of space and leverage every time, making the tests more uniform.

Note about the note: I love the fact that I needed a specialized arch for testing, and I could just design one and print it out. 3D printers are neat.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AndreasBastian/posts/52eVxAsYpZG,"+Peter Binkley's  post earlier today about designing gauntlets to print without support is a great example of how we can increase the accessibility of these devices through design.  It is entirely possible to design these devices to not require generated support material.  It's very time consuming to remove support material and it often leaves a rough surface with sharp edges.   As somebody who has run 3D printers everyday for two years, I almost never print designs that require generated support because of the additional hassle.  I think we can remove that impediment to printing by removing the need for generated support material.

On that note, I first posted about thermoforming in October and have always meant to update my old gauntlet design.  I finally had some time last week to put together an updated version that is Cyborg Beast compatible.  I am cleaning up its parametric source file (designed in Fusion) this weekend to share.  The photos include an earlier version without a tensioner-- once I get my demo Cyborg Beast Hand back, I'll try out the tensioning system.

I measured the volume with rice crispies and then used rice crispies to support what is quite a weak mould - and it worked!

fairly good accuracy - a bit strange in terms of how the tape squished - but for getting basic dimensions is very good.

It's very likely that this problem is restricted to just my Raptor, but I thought I'd post the issue just in case anyone else has had the same problem.

I was playing around with a Raptor configured in the normally closed configuration and I noticed that there is too much play in joints, such that the back of distal phalange can actually rub up against the front of the proximal phalange. Take a look at the first pic with points A and B labeled to see what I mean.

Granted, I'm using chicago screws in lieu of the snap pins so sizing is likely an issue, but I have this problem even when I use the snap pins. It makes for a whole lot of friction and jerky finger movements.

This same issue occurs in the knuckle joints. You can see in the second picture where the top of the knuckle joint is actually shiny from rubbing against the inside of the knuckle joint in the palm.

Again, this could just be due to poorly fitting chicago screws or overzealous sanding, but I wanted to flag the issue to see if anyone else was having the same problem.

Has anyone else had fingers with this much play in the joints? You know you've got a problem if Point A shown in the first pic can touch point B. There should be at least 1/16"" gap here even under load.

After experimenting with various wires and plastics, I gave up on finding what I considered to be a satisfactory way to terminate them.  Somehow it escaped my notice that +Peregrine Hawthorn 's Talon hand used the same push-pull tensioning.  After +Nicholas Hall brought this to our attention I was encouraged to take another look. 

I tried some recently acquired crimp connectors on 1.75mm Taulman Bridge Nylon filament from 3D Universe and it looked promising.  The terminated filament could be wedged into the 100% Raptor fingertip after the channel was reamed out a little with a Dremel tool.  But it still had to be held into place with some hot-glue or something like a 3Doodler.  

Then I discovered that the filament could be doubled over and wedged into the unmodified fingertip and a 1/16 inch hole could be drilled through the assembly.  A peg made from the same filament could hold the tendon in place.  Just mushroom the ends of the peg with a hot iron.

Here are two pictures of my recipient's hands that were taken about 4 days apart. The first set from the initial intake document was a bit blurry, so I had the recipient take another set of pictures.

I used the tracker software on both photos as per the instructions at the time (2 months ago). Now we just take the 1 measurement and not 20 as we did earlier. In any event, I was blown away by how big the differences were in measurements. The issue wasn't the initial scaling of the ruler in the Tracker software. I checked it a dozen times on both files. My best guess is that the issue was the angle that the photos were taken at, and the fact that lenses are round. There are probably other things that I don't understand that caused the difference.

Take a look at the first two photos for comparison. If you look at the measurements from wrist to the tip of the index finger, one photo says that the distance is 154.8mm and the other one says 127.8mm. That's a difference of nearly 2cm and 20%. Look at the distance between the wrist and the first proximal phalange joint, one photo says 70mm and the other says 80mm. Again, that's a difference of a full centimeter.

Take a look at the thumb of the affected hand. In the intake photo that he took (blurry photo) it looks like there is barely a thumb. In the second picture it's obvious he has nearly a full thumb.

These are enormous differences. I guess the big question then is ""which photo was the correct measurements that lead to a good fitting Raptor hand?"" The answer is that both photos lead to terrible fits. I went with the larger measurements from the clearer second photo, and I still wound up with a hand that was way too small. I had to increase the length of the palm by a full 20mm to get a decent fit.

The final irony is that this is these are the hands that you see when you go to the Handomatic where it instructs you on how to take measurements! Take a look at photos 3 and 4. Picture 3 is the handomatic measurement page, and picture 4 is the photo from my recipient that the photo was taken from. It's the same picture and the same hands from the same young man in the first two pictures with the wildly different tracker measurements! I was the one who did this hand, and I failed terribly.

I guess my point is, a picture is worth a 1000 words, but that doesn't mean it isn't completely wrong. If this has happened to you, and you're looking for a better way, here are a couple of ideas.

Template Check Method from +James Holmes-Siedle :
https://plus.google.com/117596495829636702960/posts/c9JHTxrmM4k

Flatbed Scanner Method another great idea from +Steve Wood: https://plus.google.com/110736851786370579318/posts/2258XdTtBf2

I think that the flatbed scanner method takes a much better picture. There is no distortion from round lenses or bad angles. Printing out a paper ruler and scanning it along with the hand gives a way to confirm that the photo is perfectly scaled when printed by checking an actual physical ruler. If you look closely at the mm marks on the steel ruler, it's matching up perfectly with the ruler on the printed page. The scanner on a $30 home document printer works well for this purpose.  A photocopier works too.

As +Bob Roth pointed out, the best possible solution is to get a mold of the hand. Alginate provides exceptional resolution. A guide to using it has already been made. The cost of the kit is $12 for the alginate, $10.00 for the plaster, and probably another $10 in shipping. The cost of the mold will exceed the cost of the hand, which is an obvious problem, but it will provide a great fitting model.

http://enablingthefuture.org/resources/creating-a-hand-casting/

A lower cost albeit lower resolution method is the ""packing tape ghost"" model from +James Holmes-Siedle. The user wraps their affected hand in many layers of packing tape, and mails the ""mold"" in a simple letter envelope. This keeps the cost below $2.00, and yields an acceptable resolution for our purposes.

1. A level bed. Duh! Set temperature at 110¬∞.
2. Pads on the corners and little bits (see the pictures).
3. Dry filament.  Put that stuff in the oven, or if you have it, a food dehydrator, and really get the water out.

The main reasons parts don't stick are corners, and peninsulas. These two features only matter on layer one.  Put a 12 mm pad of the same thickness as your layer height (you only want this on the first layer) on each feature, and it will act as a suction cup.  Believe it or not.

The reason brim doesn't work well is that the brim, as implemented in all slicers, simply follows the contour of the part.  In other words, the brim IS a corner/peninsula.  For this, we sacrifice speed (time) and all kinds of remedies to get that thing to print.

If any designers out there would like to discuss this further, just drop me a line, or pick up on this post.

Good prints to all!

https://plus.google.com/u/0/117596495829636702960/posts/TTTn6h9Fdmb,"Thinking about fingers ....

25 years ago I used to make a scorpion with a whipping tail - simple to make, drill a hole through a piece of wood, cut Vs in them that cut through the hole, and thread a rubber band - the band pulls the faces of the v together ....

so I have been playing with fingers in the same way - and remembering conversations about the tensioner, and how the tensioners get harder as the finger closes, and wondering what would happen if I put the two together .... so I did :)

The basic principle is a finger with no mechanical fixing - two ninjaflex (1.75mm) filaments are run through the finger at the bend of the V and tensioned to hold the parts together - the tension gives the finger strength, and the location of the tensioner returns the finger parts to have the joint flush. Using a pair means that the finger joint bends but does not rotate. When you bend the joint the filament stretches slightly, but bends most - and pulls the joint back into alignment.

Then add a tendon and pull - and the finger rolls up.

Then move the tendon hole further from the joint and the action is easier,

then, leave the hole location where is , but scalop the opening (see the end) tso that the tendon gets a changing leverage advantage.

Then also scalop the tensioner opening so that it clips across the joint - WOW - this means that as the joint is closed, the filament comes forward in the scalop and does not need to elongate, just bends, SUCH an easy movement. BUT - the sequence of closing is wrong - the end of the finger closes first - so then a hybrid which has the upper joint slightly harder (no scalop on the elastic) and the lower ones scalloped - this means each joint can be tuned to close in  a particular sequence.

So the point (and thanks for reading this far) was to lower the closing force, but with a good joint action and the finger self opening. So I remember some tests by +Nicholas Hall and get out my luggage scales - to measure in newtons. Not an exact science, but I took a 100% talon that I demo and had a reading of approx .3Kg - measured the option 1 = .6kg, moving the cord = .4kg, scalloping the tendon tube = .25kg, scalloping the tensioner opening drops to almost nothing.

But the finger more or less returns to it's open hand position (a slight curve which is not too bad!

I am going to try to build a hand around this technology as it does several things

1) condsiderably lowers the force of actuation - even on these big clumsy fingers!
2) uses readily available tensioner (ninjaflex) which has amazing strength, and you do not have to print it!
3) removes all snap pins
4) may allow fingers to have a simple attachment meaning they can be removed and replaces (with just the tendon needing threading)
5) could allow complex thumb action as you only need a pivoting surface - not a joint/pin
6) could allow you to pull the thumb out and into a new position - as the mechanism is just holes
7) would significantly reduce printing time - just accurate enough for surface finish and holes
8) no tensioner knots - I am just holding the tension with little pieces of electrical junction box connectors (2 small brass screws)

Not intended to be a finished solution, but I have been working on this for a month and so had to get it off my chest!

Apologies for the really poor photos!

One volunteer‚Äôs opinion by Skip Meetze

Our arm designs are not ready for the average volunteer to use.

This opinion is based on my decades of experience as a Human Factors Engineer in the development of consumer products (not including any medical products) and a 7-months experience as an e-NABLE volunteer.  Please consider it as a starting place for discussion.

In my opinion we should establish some guidelines for what prosthetic devices and under what circumstances our volunteers should feel comfortable in providing the particular devices to recipients.  We should include our whole R&D community in the discussions,   Otherwise, there will continue to be a diversity of opinions and misunderstandings about the appropriateness of various arm designs for any individual volunteer and recipient.  

Of course, our volunteers are free to do whatever they want to do with the various designs that are published within our community and elsewhere.  

Unlike the wrist-driven hands, however, there is a risk and complexity to the fitting of a prosthetic arm to an individual that needs a lot of research before we have designs that are as safe for most volunteers to undertake.  

In my opinion, our arm designs are still very much in the realm of research and development and their use should always involve people (such as prosthetists and medical professionals) who are trained and qualified to take a risk on behalf of the the recipient.

 Silica Aerogel Infused Filament for 3D printers

Fellow Makers, Inventors, and Innovators; My name is Daniel P. Lynge, and I am the Chief Science Officer and Head Alchemist for Angstrom Innovations, Inc.

Angstrom Innovations is a small Advanced Materials manufacturer based near Seattle, specializing in Hydrophobic Silica Aerogel particulates (Extreme Thermal & Electrical Insulator). What has that got to do with 3D-printing? Well, one of my hobbies is 3D modeling and printing. I‚Äôve tinkered with stuff since I can remember (like the time I got in trouble for disassembling all the telephones in the house‚Ä¶ I was 6), and got the Idea to combine the two while watching a ‚ÄúHow do they make that?‚Äù episode featuring peanut butter filled chocolates with my son‚Ä¶

You all are my type of folk, at least as far as being makers and tinkerers, hackers & inventors. I really^3 want to see what you creative types can make with an Aerogel infused 3D-printer filament. I‚Äôve combined some 200~200 mesh particulates with ABS, and mechanical/destructive testing suggests an upper limit to the Aerogel to ABS ratio. I‚Äôve seen carbon nanotube- & buckyball-, steel-, aluminum-, and other material -Infused Filaments in ABS & PLA for the 3D-printer market, and so I asked the Angstrom Beancounters, they said ‚ÄúGet positive feedback by noon Tuesday, or it‚Äôs a NO-GO‚Äù.

So, Can I get ‚ÄúPeer Review‚Äù for the concept of Silica Aerogel infused 3D-Printer Filament? Would this be a Useful Thing? I know I‚Äôm excited about it, but it‚Äôs my idea; that and $5 will get you a Mocha. As far as insulative objects made with an additive printer, do you like the idea? Would you like to have Aerogel Infused Thermoplastic Filaments? And what would you be willing to pay for a 1 lb. spool equivalent of A.I. Filament?

Thank you for your Time, and hopefully your support.

Hey everyone, I'm running into a small puzzle... I have printed the K1 hand (100% scale) and I have begun wiring it up.  However, in the model I used (and the model linked from the site) the forearm piece doesn't include the additional holes for post non-elastic knots along the backside of the bracer/wrist.

Does anyone have access or know where I can get the forearm STL for the K1 hand model with those holes?  Was this customized?  It would help close out the knots towards the back and not running along the bracer itself (which is a challenge without the knot moving).

Any advise? Thanks!

https://plus.google.com/u/0/110257220895777457001/posts/bRBZZjSJxpU,"This weekend I gave Chris version 1 of her hand.  She was quite pleased with it, and is starting to learn to use it.  She will have a steep learning curve because she has had a lifetime to develop ways to use her thumb.  Since she does not have fingers, she struggled with making the opposing motion.  Most of her adaptations involve more of a pinching motion against her palm.  She is so adept at getting by with just the thumb that she will probably not use this much other than as something to play around with, but she wanted to give it a try.

What's good about this version:
*  The fingers are the same length as those on her other hand - which makes for a very natural looking hand.  Although there was some question about if having those varied lengths would impact ability to grasp objects, that does not appear to be a problem.
*  The fingers include 3M gripping material that has made the grip of the hand very good.
*  The hand is open on the thumb side to allow Chris to use her thumb while still benefiting from the mechen fingers.
*  The knuckle block uses a neat hidden nut trap to allow a really good proximal joint using standard M4 button head screws.
*  Uses the original prototype of the string adjuster to allow tweaks to the individual finger tensions.

What isn't so good in this version:
*  I used set screws for the intermediate-proximal joint.  Screws are just lousy for finger joints.  They are not under the tension that all screws need to be effective - so they move by themselves.  I used thread lock to make them work for now.  Version 2 already has been made to use some very nice 5mm printed pins.
*  There were a lot of screws into acorn nuts in various places.  Again, screws are lousy.  To make that work you really need to tighten a standard nut, and then lock it with an acorn nut - and that becomes large and unwieldy.  Version 2 integrates some parts to eliminate some of the screws, and otherwise tries to trap the nuts to improve the situation.
*  The rubber dip on the finger tips did not turn out very clean.  In part that is because I already had the fingers on the hand when I dipped them.  In part it is because of how the string and bungee came through and was bound.  Version 2 will not have strings or bungees coming out of the finger nail or tips, and I will be able to dip the fingers before final stringing.
*  It would be good to open the hole a little more on the web portion of the thumb.  It was a bit of a tight fit there.  It might be a bit tricky to open that much, but I think I can get a few more millimeters freed.
*  The closure for the hand and arm sections are pretty primitive.  Chris didn't want me to spend a lot of time working on those parts because she wants to work on it to make it something that will work for her.


All told, I think this was a good start.  It was more of a project than I expected when I took it on.  I originally thought I was just going to download the Robohand parts from Thingiverse and print them.  It has proven to be a bit more involved than that.

I am now hard at work on the next version.  I expect that one will be a big jump ahead of this first attempt.

This is what I'm imagining right now. It would just move one of the side walls out a little. It would put the fingers slightly off center, but only a little. The idea isn't that you add a dozen spacers as the kid goes from 5 years old to 10, just that he gets to go up one size.

The user would start off with just the left wall attached to the main palm. After he outgrew that, he could take off the left wall, add in a spacer, and put the left wall back on outside of that. Some experimentation would show how big the spacer should be and whether a potential second spacer would be useful.

I first thought about something that would split the hand down the middle, but that seems more complicated and problematic. Also, having a big gap between the middle fingers might look worse than having the fingers be off center.

For attaching the two main parts and the spacer, I'm mainly thinking that a couple of channels for screws could be added to the top of the hand.

I am a Dutch student in the last year of pre-univeristy stream and I made this recombination for a school project. I had to come up with a subject where I could work on for at least 80 hours. I choosed to do my project about 3D-printed handprosthetics that's why I eventually made this recombination.
It is based on two designs of the Enabling Community Foudation: the flexy hand and the unlimbited arm.
To make the perfect recombination, I started with some research about 3D-printing and handprosthetics in general. And then I did some research about how the Enabling Community Foundation used a new technology to deal with real world problems. I found this very inspiring and I really hope that the community will grow and grow untill all children with needs are helped. I know it is kind of a very high goal ;). But in order to do so I think more people should get inspired by the community, like I did. And that's the reason I am sharing my redesign.
So I'm curious if you like it :).
And If you wanted to know more about my project, my research and my inspiration don't hesitate to ask. I would love to send you my 70 pages project, even if i need to translate them for you.

Gauntlet design:
Had a couple of questions bouncing around my head for a bit
Maybe the experienced designers here can help clear things up

1- Is there a distinct advantage or disadvantage associated with the length of the gauntlet? ie. torque or more tendon extension? I've thought that the gauntlets could be reduced in length without affecting anything. But then +Bob Roth's design had the connection way up the forearm so maybe I'm mistaken....

2- Are the straps the only thing that hold the hand in place? I don't mean when just bending the wrist. Would the kids be able to use their hands to lift or hold heavy things? Or would the hand slide off if they try. In the case of my daughter even the sleeves of her clothes slide over her wrist.....

That being said, moving the gauntlet up to where Bob had it might help in this regard. Maybe if it's fastened up where the forearm muscles begin, the curvature there will hold things up?

We have learned from past experiences that teams create successful end products and insure a task is followed through to completion.  With this in mind, we would like to take that approach with the forums as well.  

+Joe Cross will be able to share the testing guidelines and is creating a test plan to move forward and will share that with anyone who would like to be involved with the process.  Just a couple of points to keep in mind:

1. Forums are a great place to discuss technical matters so that is a great place to start.  

Our Google+ community is ""home"" and we don't want to stray away from that.  

2. We would like testing to begin the beginning of next week. 

3. Several formats are sure to be tested and then a comparison completed so options can be weighed.  

Most of all....have FUN!

Joining the e-Nable community for me was a no-brainer as it gives me the opportunity to help others, and learn from others.

I completed my first Raptor Hand model, in low resolution, just to familiarize myself with the entire process, from printing to assembly.  I am now experimenting with a different type of tensor material, where I don't have to rely on my knots (not very good at that), but instead use miniature crimpers.

My name is Andrew Moore.  I am a test engineer for a non-profit research institution in San Antonio TX.  In my day job, I develop test methods and systems for evaluating tactical mobile robots.  (That means I actually get paid to break other people‚Äôs robots‚Ä¶ and we call it science!)    If you look up videos of the DARPA Robotics Challenge Trials from December 2013, you will see some of my work.  I didn‚Äôt build the robots, but I was part of the team that designed the tests the robots had to perform (photographic evidence attached). 
As part of my day job, I also attend ASTM standards committee meetings.  This involves a lot of documentation and nit-picking over the meaning of words.  It's not the most exciting thing in the world, but it is an important part of helping the robotics community to build better robots. 
In that spirit, I hope to use what I‚Äôve learned from over a decade of testing research robots to help the e-Nable community improve their own processes and products.

This is a change I am making to the tuners on my Second Degree hand.  There will be a shield over the springs - so the tuner will just look a bit longer than usual.

The problem this is trying to solve is related to grasping an irregular object.  When you close a mechen hand, all the fingers pull at the  same rate.  Now imagine that the index finger has hit the object and cannot move any further.  At that point either the index tries to continue closing and crushes/breaks the object, or the index and all fingers stop so the other fingers do not get proper contact and the grip is poor, or the hand breaks.

In the pictured solution, the springs are selected such that they will not compress with the normal line tension for closing the fingers.  Once a finger is stopped, however, the springs then compress to absorb additional wrist flex.  That means that the other fingers can continue to close on the object without a stopped finger putting too much pressure (either on the object or the hand).  This doesn't give you a ton more motion (maybe 7-10mm more once a finger has been stopped), but it is enough extra to be noticeable.

Simple solution.  I feel kind of silly that I didn't think of it sooner.  Only hard part is finding just the right springs.  They have to be just the right diameter and strength.  That said, I was able to find these ones just grubbing through an old box of springs in the basement.  I have tested them tied to a new hand and they work fine.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I just wanted to thank you all for your devotion and support of this effort to help build and develop affordable patient specific hand prosthetics. This group has made giant leaps to produce functional, easily printable, easily assemble(able), and aesthetically pleasing devices.  

However, i have a challenge!!! I think it is very possible to maintain these previously achieved design goals while attempting to better emulate the physiological biomechanics of the hand. There are several aims that can be targeted, I'll just talk about one for now. First i would shoot to better appropriate moment distribution of the DIP,PIP, and MCP joints. In my experience (and correct me if im wrong) the order of activation and the distribution of moments about these joints in the current designs are disproportionate to the normal hand. This is not to be unexpected, after all the original design goals were to make functional, cheap, durable hands that anyone can make. I believe we have achieved those goal and with this pool of talent can do much more than that. Thoughts?

So many great things are falling into place since then with many more cool hands to come.

I was able to send hands to the conference, and donate a couple spools to enable members in the process as well. Thank you again Ollie!!! I really cant wait to get into this filament more.

If you've ever gripped a large object in your hand, you've probably noticed that your palm does a lot of work. Pick up a glass of water and you'll see what I mean. The palms on e-nable hands do this same work, but they do it less well.

There are a few reasons for this. The first is friction, the second is shape.

Friction:

On many hands, the palms are just the slick backside of velcro. +Peregrine Hawthorn  and +Peter Binkley  have improved upon this with leather; among it's virtues is increased friction. +Andreas Bastian  pioneered the thermoformed palm which I believe to be a big step forward (while noting +Adam Arabian  concerns regarding proprioception). Still even the thermoformed palms are generally just slick, low friction PLA. I'm not sure what the coefficient of friction is for printed PLA, but I don't think it's terribly good. What to do?

High Friction Alternatives:

1. Plastidip: A thermoformed palm can be painted with plastidip to increase it's coefficient of friction and thus considerably improving gripping ability of large objects. Obviously, the thermoformed palms have lots of little holes in them, and we don't want plastidip on the part the child will be touching with his sock covered hand. We also don't want to lose the wonderful ventilation that these holes confer. One solution is to press the thermoformed palm into playdough so that the holes are plugged (not too deep or it'll be a bear to get out). Once all those little holes are plugged, paint away with the plastidip. Remove from playdough while the plastidip is still wet. Repeat for a second coat. Another option is to put some plastidip in a shallow tray and dip the palm just enough to cover only the surface (this assumes it's one of +Andreas Bastian  marvelous bolt on thermoformed mesh palms which are detachable). Either way, we have a high friction palm in the color of our choice (or in the very least the color of our choice within the plastidip pallette).

2. Oogoo: Folks have doubtlessly been relieved that I haven't posted anything regarding oogoo for a full year. Sadly, one year was the longest I could between singing the virtues of the stuff. If you don't know what it is, a quick search of the forum should yield some posts from last fall explaining: how to bond it to meshes, how to generate any mesh you can dream up effortlessly in openSCAD using +Laird Popkin wonderful MeshMaker, or how to glue it in place with DAP All Purpose Silicone Adhesive. Basically, the idea would be to either adhere it a palm either by encapsulating it mechanically in a mesh, or simply glued on with DAP All Purpose Silicone Adhesive. Bingo, you now have yourself a high friction palm and the ability to easily hold on to all sorts of things.

3. Ninjaflex/Filaflex: You can print a palm in filaflex. Although this admittedly is bit more tricky, +Steve Wood  has shown us that it can be done, and that it opens up astonishing possibilities. For example, you can decide what shape you want the palm to be. This brings me to my next point.


Palm Shape Alternatives:

There are many shapes and textures that are excellent for holding a wide variety of objects. A smooth flat surface is probably the least useful of these. Granted, a thermoformed palm is a big improvement, because it is no longer flat after it's formed around the recipients limb. Still, it's possible to create a variety of shapes that are wonderfully useful in holding objects on a palm. Changing the shape is even more effective when the raised area is made out of a soft material that conforms to the object being held.

1. Oogoo: Last time I'll mention oogoo this year, but if you're going to have a high friction palm, why not make it out of something soft that will conform to the shape that you're holding? Your grip will increase exponentially as a result. Print a mold for Oogoo like Andreas Bastion did and play around with the shape you want your palm to be. One cool trick is to create an oogoo foam (linked below), and glue a layer of 1/8th inch thick oogoo ""skin"" over it.

It faithfully recreates the soft conforming grip of our real human palms. Poke the base of you palm where it meets your thumb. See how nice that is? That's a million years of evolution that we can recreate with 25 cents worth of glycerine, baking soda, vinegar, corn starch, and type 1 silicone!

2. Ninjaflex Filaflex: In the glorious future, all printers will print this stuff with complete ease right out of the box. The possibilities are endless with this marvelous material. For the adventurous I think its worth experimenting with this stuff. +Steve Wood  has posted some excellent guides on how to set up your rig for flawless filaflex prints on this forum. At any rate, it's possible to print any palm shape you want, and you can control the thickness of the skin, and the infill is variable to adjust the amount of ""squishyness"" you want to replicate the durometer of a human palm.

Conclusion: This post is already much longer than I intended it to be so I'll stop there. It's been a long, hard year since I've posted anything to this forum and I guess I forgot how to be succint. I've been marveling at all of the wonderful advances you amazing folks have made in the hand designs. I'm thrilled with the thermoformed guantlet with the reverse dovetail; it's 10x stronger than the old way, and it looks a treat! Kudos to +Drew Murray  and +Stephen Davies. Another standout for me is the adaptive tensioner box from +Jason Bryant. Also +Skip Meetze marvelous Modular Training Arm. Seeing all these great innovations, I couldn't resist tossing some palm design ideas out there for better minds than I to consider.

FACT: The palm is largest surface are of the human grip, but the area we've done the least work on. I hope someone out there has some spare time on their hands to play around with it a bit!

I've been developing ""thermo-extensible"" structures recently that print in a compact conformation and can then be thermoformed into a more sparse, but structurally-sound shape.  I used an early uni-directional extensible mesh on the thermomesh raptor palm, but I've since worked out bi-directionally extensible and radially-symmetric mesh designs and applied those to the socket problem this afternoon.  This design pictured is a rough draft-- I already see several problems with the socket frame and intend to re-design now that I have a handle on the appropriate mesh design to use here.  I'm pretty happy with how strong the resulting parts are-- there's a significant strength gain from the curvature of the mesh.  I also used beefy pipe threading on the top of the socket and the threads resolved nicely.  Does anybody have any other ideas about how to attach a piece of pipe or metal to this, ideally using materials from the hardware store or printed parts?

I think that it's effectively a difference in lever arm length and consequently the length of the arc described by the motion of the flexion of the wrist that causes this difference:  shorter palm, shorter lever arm, shorter arc of action, shorter deflection of the fingers, poorer functionality.  

I also found that the exit angle of the elastics from the proximal phalanges is very important.   On the thumb, the elastic is forced to exit the proximal  joint at a tangent, the most mechanically efficient direction for the restraining force.  However, on the other four fingers, the elastics exit at a slight angle off-tangent and consequently the elastics have a harder time restraining the motion of the fingers.  

Finally, I realize that I hadn't mentioned this before, but I've been making gauntlets with one strip of velcro anchored on one side and threaded through the other so that it can be tightened effectively and with only on hand.  It requires a little hot-glue or stitch-work to make the velcro sides engage properly, but I think it's an improvement on the ""two-flap"" option.

Here are some of it's features

- Certified Food Safe
- Roughly 30 durometer (just about perfect!)
- Silicone is clear/transparent and can be tinted any color
- Adheres directly to plastic (no mesh, no cotton intermediary)
- Available over the counter (Home Depot)
- $1.50 per ounce
- Standard 2.8oz package size (enough for 5 fingers & palm)
-  Type 1 Silicone (acetoxy)

I'm pretty pleased with this stuff. I didn't think it would be possible, but by golly it's stuck like superglue!

The mix is as follows

1oz DAP All-Purpose Adhesive Sealant 100% Silicone
2 tsp corn starch
8 drops black artist acrylic
 
The fingertip looks like something the cat dragged in, but I didn't use a mold, I just spread it on with a plastic spoon. It could look like a million bucks if you used the incredible fingertip mold that +Andreas Bastian created.

I got the idea while I was dreaming up a rig using a reciprocating saw with the blade connected to the tension cables of a Raptor hand to perform repetitive opening and closing. I'm curious to see how long it takes before the hand falls apart :)

I can buy a Harbor Freight reciprocating saw that will do the job for about $25. It has variable speeds from 0 Strokes Per Minute (SPM) to 2500 SPM. I was thinking the lower end of the range would be advisable. At 2500 strokes per minute, I think the hand would probably  explode.

Before it explodes though, I was thinking that the hand would get pretty darn hot. Maybe hot enough to melt the PLA in the spots with the worst friction.

That's when it hit me. You could run the simulation at about 60 SPM for a few minutes and the hand would do just fine, but the spots where the friction was the worst would start to heat up. If you could take a picture of that with thermal imaging, you'd be able to see where the worst friction was just as plain as day. You could compare chicago screws to snap pins. You could compare .5mm dyneema fishing line to nylon shade cord.

The only trouble is, I don't have a thermal imaging camera, and I'm pretty sure I don't know anyone who does. Does anybody have thoughts on how I might get access to one? For example, what sort of job might require having such a tool in one's toolbox? Maybe I can track someone down who is likely to have one that I can borrow for overnight.

A better question is if anyone has done this with our hands? An even better question is, ""is this just a dumb idea to begin with?""

https://plus.google.com/u/0/110736851786370579318/posts/F7cMtZhG5kz,"Grip Efficiency:

I've been thinking quite a bit about grip strength. Both how to increase it, and how to measure it. But after playing around with my normally closed Raptor actuated by strong elastics, I got to thinking about grip efficiency. The hands seem to require an enormous amount of force input, to achieve a relatively small grip force output.

Factors like friction, and dynamics of the grip matter tremendously. This became readily apparent after placing very large forces on the hand in a direction it was never intended to go. The friction was considerable. The joints were not at all happy. But this just highlighted to me that the same thing must be occurring with relatively lesser forces; it's just less perceptible.

A few things that struck me were:

1. The friction of the tension cord consumes no small amount of force. In fact the more gripping force that is generated, the more energy that friction consumes. If that's the case, it could be that the default shade cord that comes in the Cyborg Beast kit isn't the right cord for the job. It has a very large diameter ~2mm, and consequently a very large surface area, and therefore it generates quite a bit of friction. The 100# dyneema fishing line is .5mm and it stands to reason that it creates substantially less friction due to this surface area.

2. The joints themselves generate enormous friction, which  increases in proportion to the force placed on them. They're like butter when there is little force, however when you put them under increasing load, you can hear the friction. I took a great deal care to sand them each progressively from 200grit all the way up through 500grit to make them as smooth as possible. Even so, I could hear the friction when opening the hand. This made me wonder how snap pins compare in efficiency relative to chicago bolts, which have a much smoother surface.

3. The small elastic used in the normally open configuration may well consume as much force in elongating as is generated for the grip, especially in smaller children with minimal wrist strength. If a child is only able to produce 1kg of wrist flexion force, and that translates into .2kg of potential gripping force in the fingers, and the elastics consume 0.1kg, the poor kid only has 0.1kg of gripping force left over (he's lost half his potential gripping force to the elastic). What's worse, it does so at precisely the worse possible point in the grip (when the grip is fully closed). This is due to the fact that the elastic creates more resistance the further it is stretched.

I could go on, but all of this stuff is probably obvious to the majority of you. It's new to me, but my mechanical aptitude barely qualifies me to change a tire, let alone design a hand!

In any event, adding large forces to the hand via strong elastic tubing really highlighted for me how each of the things listed above impact the efficiency of the hand. I was initially interested in measuring grip strength, but I realize that it's much more precise to say that what I'm interested in measuring is grip efficiency.

Presumably I'm not the first person to wonder about this, and since there some talented and brilliant engineers, hackers, and tinkerers in the bunch, it strikes me as likely that someone has rigged up an apparatus to test the efficiency of the hands.

So I guess my question is, has anyone tested the efficiency of the hands by measuring how much force on the tension wire is required to generate a given gripping force? If so, can you post your results and a picture of your testing apparatus?

I've been thinking about how to do it using spring balances and clamps and all manor of gadgets, but I realize I'm probably the least qualified person in the world to figure out how to do this effectively!
