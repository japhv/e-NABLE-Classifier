https://plus.google.com/u/0/+SkipMeetze/posts/84Bau3ifZrY,"+Christopher Hills,    I liked +Bob Roth 's notion of opening up the thumb opening with a dramel tool, but decided to try and save the forefinger on the Raptor hand by stretching the length without changing the height or width.  Then I increased the thumb opening from about 27mm to about 46mm.  This was done in Tinkercad  using the 100% Raptor Left Palm No Thumb 2.2.  

I'm thinking you can try scaling it in your slicer (all 3 axis) proportional to my 70mm width across the knuckles but  keeping the width the same as your experimental print.

I also included a palm cushion based on the Raptor Adaptor.

Assignment was simple:""create a prosthetic hand that can pick up a can and pour into a glass."" We 3d printed the hand in one piece, so the hinges are printed in and you can not take the fingers apart, so no hard assembling there. The black rubbers are for more grip. We also used a string pull mechanism, but we had a servo motor for each finger so you could move them separately (one elastic broke, so that's why the finger don't open as it should). There was a pressure sensor on the thumb so we could measure when there was enough force, to pick up the can. We used a roller bearing for the wrist and the pulling strings went through the center of the bearing. We had to keep our design under €250. As student we had limited time and not that much research resources. I'm new to the community from today, but I certainly like to help in the future with designs and stuff.

I was searching the internet for alternative examples of prosthetic hands and I came across a really neat one. It was a commercially available hand that had appeared to have a really interesting feature. The full open position of our hands occur when the wrist is straight, or parallel with the forearm, and closes when the wrist is bent to -90 degrees. This hand achieved full open when the wrist was +90 degrees to the forearm, and fully closed when the wrist is straight. The opposite of our hands.

This may sound like a minor change, but I think it's significant. The gripping force that we're able to achieve is a function of the force created by wrist flexion in conjunction with the moment arm of the movement. I'm not a physicist, so please correct my terrible misuse of terms when I miss the mark. In layman's terms, if I apply a fixed force to a wrench and turn it 90 degrees to make a bolt turn 1"", then I can double the force if I use gearing and make a 180 degree turn to make the bolt turn the same 1"".

The way it would apply to the fingers, is that rather than using a 90 degree movement of the wrist to go from full open to full close, you use the full 180 degree movement of the wrist to go from fully open to fully close. In short, the fingers would be straight when wrist was bent +90 degrees and fully closed when it was at -90 degrees.

I think this principle could be used to double the gripping strength of a hand.

What's even more exciting is that when you're carrying something heavy like a briefcase handle in your hand, the weight of the object, and the vertical force vector forces you're wrist to be straight. Since having your wrist straight in this hand closes the fingers to the 50% closed grip position, the actual weight of the object is the force that closes the grip! The same principles apply to pulling on an object like a refrigerator door. That's pretty cool.

This puts the grip strength back into the upper arms and shoulders which can develop significantly more power than the wrist. In this case you could more than double the gripping strength. Watch the video at 1 min and 40 secs to see what I mean.

That's the theory, and I think it could work, but I'm not a biomechanical engineer by a long shot. What do you guys think?

We have been  developing some concepts based on ideas discussed among +Peter Binkley  +Andreas Bastian  +Jeff Erenstone  +Jon Schull  +Aaron Brown  and I at the AU event in Vegas a few weeks ago.  The idea is to use the print-flat and thermoform concepts under development to make an arm for trans-humeral (above elbow) amputees for situations like Haiti.  
     I have built on the idea presented by +Shashi Jain  and his interns a while back to propose a concept for using inexpensive ($10 at Lowe’s this week) battery-powered screwdriver to drive the arm.  Instead of the lead screw proposed by Shashi and team, I’m developing a worm-gear mechanism.  
     As Shashi said, it should be easy to replace the AA batteries with rechargeable lithium polymer batteries (now commonly used in quadcopters) and whack off the end of the battery ends of the screwdrivers to save room.  One motor could drive the elbow joint and the other a gripper thumb.  
     Hopefully, some clever volunteers can come up with mechanical switches to use some kind of body movement to drive the motors back and forward.   These designs have not been prototyped yet.  I’m trying to get some parts printed from local 3D Hub while visiting the kids in GA :-) I’ll share the stl files soon.

I was able to fix it by drilling two holes through the palm in roughly the same spot, so it's not a deal breaker. It's also just a PLA hand that I'm sending my recipient to test the fit and ergonomics before I do the final print in ABS, so it's not critical that it isn't perfect.

It's really stretchy, and you can wrap it around anything for a bomb-proof repair. Lobstermen use it in Maine to do emergency repairs on hydraulic lines, radiator lines, you name it.

You can wrap it around a hose like hockey tape, and when you're done, you've got an unbelievably strong repair. I tried wrapping it around fingertips and it worked really well to give a form fitting, high friction, conforming grip in just a few seconds.

It's a bit expensive, but it's really neat stuff. I thought I'd put it out there in case there was someone working on something where this might be handy.

I finally figured out a way to glue oogoo to plastic. I learned early on that oogoo bonds to cotton t-shirt fabric amazingly well; the oogoo tears before the bond fails.

It stood to reason that if I could glue a swatch of cotton t-shirt fabric to a Raptor finger, I could then glue the oogoo to the cotton. Suffice to say it worked. In fact, it worked so well, that I can't get the stuff off at all, and now I have to print a new Raptor finger.

The first step was to cut a round swatch of cotton t-shirt fabric about 1"" in diameter. Then I spread an extremely light coat of ""Amazing Goop"" all purpose adhesive on the raptor fingertip (thanks +Skip Meetze for recommending this stuff). Then I stuck my little cotton swatch on the wet glue on the fingertip and conformed it around the curves. While the glue was setting, I spent about 2 minutes mixing up a batch of my regular oogoo mix. Then I just spread the oogoo on the cotton that was glued to the fingertips.

That's it.

It's nowhere near as fun as playing with 3d printed mechanically bonding meshes, but it works like a champ.

You can get a sense for how squishy and tough oogoo is from the picture with the ruler. It's easy as pie to sink the (sharp) steel ruler 3mm deep into the oogoo with no damage. I'm guessing the durometer is somewhere between 15-20, which is pretty close to human fingertips.

This particular fingertip looks ugly as sin, but with a decent mold it could look downright pretty :)

It may seem far fetched that volunteers will ever use this stuff, but it would be pretty easy to prepackage 2oz of FDA approved Type 1 silicone in a foil packet and 1oz of cornstarch in an e-nable kit. It would add about 25 cents to the cost of a kit.

For that matter, if we're going to be prepackaging stuff, we may as well go straight to smooth-on and get the good stuff (as +Laird Popkin pointed out). Oogoo is fun stuff, but it can't begin to compare to what smooth-on can create with 2 part platinum catalysts.

We could get Dragon-Skin or some other custom formulated product pre-packaged in 2oz foil packets for us. If we asked very nicely, they might sell us a few 50gallon drums at cost. Getting it packaged in foil packets (like ketchup) isn't terribly difficult.

What an excellent idea this
I've been using this as a dowel pin replacement. Instead of making the ends of the pieces a tight fit, I just melt the ends of the spike and it sticks

The idea was to use this in the proof of concept stage and in the end use proper hardware

Which brings me to my question. With the new Taulman3d nylon filaments that are available now wouldn't this method make a nylon spike that is much stronger than ABS or PLA...?
Any reason that the same process might not work with nylon?

Friction wastes a lot of energy. A great deal of the limited mechanical force our recipients are able to generate with their wrist is lost to friction in the finger joints.

I noticed this when I put together my first hand and realized that I hadn't sanded the joints nearly enough. I could feel the resistance in the joints from PLA scraping PLA. Once I had taken the hand apart again, and resanded everything, the action was significantly smoother.

This got me thinking about lubricants. Anyone who's ever put a drop of oil on a squeaky hinge can attest to the seemingly miraculous improvement of the hinge joint. Suddenly the door that was hard to open now seems to swing with the slightest breeze.
I believe the same could be true for our PLA/ABS fingers.

The obvious problem is that you don't want to put chain grease on a child's prosthetic hand. They'll be holding bananas, and picking up grapes; there are also implications for skin irritation.

Then I started thinking about food machinery. It needs to lubricated too. A short google search later, and I found that there are a gazillion FDA approved lubricants for food processing machinery. The picture is the a tube of mineral oil based lubricant. You can spread it on toast and eat it you wanted.

I'm not an engineer, and I know nothing about lubrication, but I think it's an interesting question. Would lubricating the joints with food grade lubricant improve the performance of the fingers? If so, what lubricant do you think would work best for the application?",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

The clip in the back worked awesomely well.

+Skip Meetze 's 'flat' gauntlet was very easy to print, and to thermoform. I just put the gauntlet on a plate, added a little water, and microwaved it. After 30 seconds, the PLA was starting to be soft, and at 1 minute it was very soft, but hot too hot to handle - I reached in, picked the plastic up, and bent in into shape. I kept the ""ribs"" parallel by putting them flat on the kitchen counter, and they came out level and square. Once it cools and hardens, which takes only a few seconds, you can stick the part you need softer back in the water, which I did with the ""arches"", and after 10 seconds or so it's soft enough that you can adjust things. All done with bare hands, and no boiling water. And not only is the flat gauntlet extremely easy to print, it's very strong. I printed it at 100% fill, since it's so thin that hollow wouldn't save material - and I wanted to make sure that the thick parts stayed stiff even though the thin parts were soft. The flat gauntlet is thinner than the ""standing up"" one, and it's more compact, with no support, so it prints very quickly.

So, all in, call be a happy camper. The community's designers continue to amaze and delight!

So I got to playing in my basement with silicone, glycerine, cornstarch, and cheap 50 cent artist acrylics. I was pretty excited by the results. This stuff is super fun to play with. Try it!

Let me know if the video seems jerky. I uploaded it directly to the site. If it's jerky, I'll try uploading to youtube and linking.

Results:

Color: The Oogoo takes color really well. You can see in the videos that it takes on brilliant colors. It just takes a few drops of artist acrylic

Durometer: +Luis Herranz  helpfully pointed out in the earlier post that varying the amount of cornstarch significantly changes the elasticity and squishiness (durometer) of the Oogoo. You make it hard like an eraser by adding more cornstarch, or soft like an elastic by adding less.

Glycerine: This was my favorite stuff to add. The red piece in the video made by adding just 2 tablespoons of silicone and 8 drops of glycerine (no cornstarch at all). It rapidly turns into an amazing silcone just like you find on a store bought spatula. The tricky part is that it cures almost too quickly, you've got about 5 minutes to form it and it's already started to cure. Adding a bit of cornstarch seemed to slow down the set time. I've heard adding mineral spirits will slow the cure time, and turn it into more of liquid for molding. I bought the glycerine for $5.00 at the drug store. It's 99.5% glycerine, and can be found in the soap isle. It's used in making soap, and it's safe for small hands :)

Elasticity: This stuff is incredibly elastic. Take a look at the video to see what I mean. I'm a 200lb guy and I can't tear it.

Durability: It's incredibly tough stuff. It can be cut with a knife, but you've got to put real effort into damaging it. The hand would break long before you've done anything more than scuff this stuff.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is the shiftable one-way device I'm working on that could facilitate ""ratcheting"" fingers so that grip could be sustained without continuous effort, or an accessory drive for things like screwdrivers or a jar lid opening gadget, etc., where the wearer repeatedly flexes the elbow or wrist, and the tool advances like a ratchet. This uses Sprag clutches, which have almost zero backlash, and can be turned in tiny increments. In a ratchet, you need to advance the mechanism past the pawl in order for it to advance. 

I just printed and built this concept model assembly, and it works as expected (there's a small error in my animation, but the concept is proven in the printed asssembly). The Sprag units are available online for $5, and for $5, I'm happy with the quality. The specific drill apex holder may prove more difficult to source. The outside diameter needs to be 10 mm.

I'll be working to turn this into a component that could be incorporated into a gauntlet hinge or a wrist portion for an RIT arm. I'm thinking this would require a pull-pull configuration as the strings would have to be relatively tight around the driving spool.

Those programs might minimize  costs to clients, OR they might somehow fund the educational programs from Robo Hand revenues.  All TBD.  

Regardless if our venture succeeds, we will probably want to make our financial and legal practices transparent.

Another issue I'd like to understand is the conditions under which medical insurance could underwrite this effort.   Our methods are probably an order of magnitude less costly than those of traditional prosthetic programs.  That's a big value-add (as they say in the business world).  How can we capture some of that value to fund our efforts

The raptor build I did seemed a bit thin in the tendon channels. I held it up to the overhead light to highlight how thin it is. You can tell from the light coming through that it's just only about ~1mm thick.

My concern is that this area will be prone to cracking/fracture in the event of an impact. My recipient is an 11 year old boy, and I can imagine this thing getting some hard use (in fact I hope it does!)

Is this the normal thickness of the Raptor in this area? Could something have gone wrong in the slicing or scaling that may have caused this?

One thing I thought about trying was to increase the ""number of shells"" in makerbot or repetier. Would increasing the ""Shell"" thickness improve the issue, or would it just cause unintended consequences? My understanding is that the shells build towards the center to replace infill, so it shouldn't affect the sizing of parts. That said, I'm not sure that it would make any difference because there is no infill in this portion to speak of. Thoughts?

I'm wondering if anyone has ever printed a gauntlet that they couldn't crush in their hand.

The gauntlet's I've printed in the past have always seemed pretty weak. I saw one last weekend that didn't even survive the shipment to a recipient. The maker had mailed it along with the hand via UPS Next Day Air (at his own expense!) at a cost of $50. It was in several pieces when it arrived.

Since I had a spare gauntlet in my basement, I decided to do a crush test to see how strong my own gauntlets were. I printed it on a makerbot 5th gen, with 4 shells, 30% infill, in PLA.

There's some yellow silicone oogoo foam glued to it, but that did nothing to impair it's strength, if anything it probably strengthened it as evidenced by the fact that it broke on the opposite side. I also painted one side with resin intended for fiberglass to see how this affected durability. It helped, but not enough.

Watch the video to see how weak this thing was.

Now I know these gauntlets are not designed to resist crushing in this way. I also know there are about 100 variables that go into like slicer settings, nozzle temp, etc. My intent is not to solicit advice on any of these parameters.

I'm wondering if anyone has ever printed a gauntlet that they can't easily crush in their hand. Can ABS gauntlets be crushed this easily? Has anyone ever perfected their settings to print PLA that can't be easily crushed in their hand? Maybe I really am just printing these totally wrong.

For a given and constant range of motion theta, the height of the cable exit channels from the palm ra, and the length of the palm rb, which can be used to describe action arc lengths arc_a and arc_b, which relate theta to the deflection of the fingers.  I'm still working out the exact mathematical relationship between ra and rb, but intuitively and in practice rb seems to have a positive relationship with finger deflection.  I think it's directly related to the length of the arc described by the proximal joint-- when this is longer, this translates to more deflection of the fingers.  I'll have to sit down this weekend and maybe try summing moments to get a more precise relationship.  

That being said, I'd also like to verify any model with a robust explanation for why the short palm didn't close as far too.  I think arc_a is pretty constant between the two palms, and don't think that arc_b is shorter than arc_a on the short palm.  And it seems like the shorter palm would be more ""responsive"" to wrist flexion.  Work in progress for sure.  ",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I decided to take a break from my quixotic obsession with normally closed hands, and take a stab at implementing two of the normally closed hands best features into an otherwise standard Raptor with a normally open grip.

It can move between normal Raptor mode and lock grip mode by stretching the elastics and locking them against a simple hook at the back of the gauntlet. In lock grip mode, the grip is fully adaptive; it allows each finger to independently conform to any shaped object.  It also uses speargun elastics, and speargun fittings, which is fun in and of itself :)

Instead of the tendons being attached to the front of the guantlet, like a standard Raptor with an Owen's tensioner, the tendons go through the whole block, and are held against the back of it with a simple fishing line crimp. This allows the hand to operate as a normal Raptor does most of the time (normally open grip)

However, the big change is that the tendon lines are now able to move backwards towards the back of the gauntlet freely (they can move backwards, but are not able move past the tension block due to the fishing line crimp). This allows for the introduction of 5 speargun elastics roughly 3 inches in length (Speargun Elastics!). The speargun elastics are can be enormously powerful, and come in a variety of diameters to adjust grip strength.

Simple fittings are inserted into each end of the speargun tube and attached on one end to the tendons, and on the other end, to a buckle.

To engage the adaptive lock grip, the other hand is used to stretch the elastic and secure the buckle around a hook at the back of the gauntlet. If you want to get fancy, you can add a couple of hooks to vary the grip strength (not shown in the pictures, but easy to do).

The grip is disengaged manually by releasing the buckle. When this happens, the tendon lines simply slide back against the tensioner block, and the hand goes right back to being a normal raptor functionally.

I designed this particular contraption as an experiment to see if I can build a hand that my recipient can use for canoeing, but there are a variety of activities that call for a strong, sustained grip: biking, umbrella holding, dog walking, briefcase carrying, you name it. The nice thing about the grip is that it is full adaptive.

In any event, that's what I put together tonight, but the wheels are still spinning. I'd love to hear what folks think of it. If anyone is interested, I could use some help with getting a 3d designed prototype that I can print out. You can see from the pictures that I have only the barest grasp of sketchup; extending the gauntlet length and adding the hook is well beyond my meager modeling skills.

In any event, the pictures should give a pretty good idea of how it works. I'd love to hear what you guys would do to improve upon it.

All mechanical assitive devices with body-powered mechanism have the risk to develop some symptoms of overusage - swelling, redness, bruses and fatigue. 

what i've analysed from most of open-source assistive devices for persons with partial hand defiencies, the tightest spot is at wrist art. location, becouse the 'wrist mount' part attaches from the inside to palm component.  Especially when these devices are custom scaled not adjusted to specific shape of residual limb, it's important to make sure device is properly cusioned.

Scale, cusion visely, and ask for feedback!
6 month usage is far too long to notice symptoms of muscle fatigue.
1) Check if resistance of extension mech. is suited for patients - especially for short resisual residual limbs and young participants.
2) after short usage of device check, if no redness is noticable, so it don't get worse. 
It's allways cheaper to print another hand than realise the concequences. Quite often young participants are more excited about hand itself than noticing some discomfort.

If anyone has some more info about Coarsey C., Weinthal C. Paper# F4, please share, i would love to read more, what actual modifications they realised as necessary.

Requiring prospective volunteers to create a test hand performs two useful functions in the current system: validating that they have the technical resources and skills to create a working hand, and giving them a chance to troubleshoot issues before a hand goes to a recipient. While these two things are valuable in and of themselves, the resultant hand, which required dozens of hours printing and work, generally goes to waste.

There's a better way.

What if instead of those hands being used as paperweights, they were sent to actual users who already have an e-nable hand? This confers some great benefits to E-nable,  the volunteer, and the recipient:

A. Validation of Build Quality: As it currently stands, prospective volunteers print to hand but there's really no validation mechanism to confirm that the hand is well-built. To my knowledge the hands aren't sent to some central lab. Setting up the logistics of such a scheme is an enormous effort unto itself. If instead, test hands are sent to a recipient who already has a functional well-built hand, the user himself (or his parents) are in the best possible position to confirm that the hand is functional. For example, there is a fair bit of post-processing that needs to be done for a hand to work smoothly. Whether or not hand is working smoothly is not something that can be seen in a photograph. However a user that currently has a well tuned hand can easily compare whether or not the fingers are opening and closing smoothly without too much friction. Likewise if the hand falls apart in the first day of use that's  a pretty good sign to build quality wasn't very good!

B. Testing New Hands: New hand designs need to be tested. A great example is the FlexyHand 2 +Steve Wood. This brilliant design simply hasn't been deployed very much and there is a dearth of feedback on it. It's a brilliant design that should be tested. I'd like to see two dozen of these out in the field. A great way to get promising hand designs out in the field is to require prospective volunteers to build them as test hands and send them to recipient who already has a good functioning hand. Again there's no better person to evaluate a design than a recipient who is already proficient in using an e-nable hand. This is a really quick way to get real-world feedback on the design. If a kid has of Raptor Reloaded that he's been using for several months he's in a pretty good position to evaluate a FlexyHand 2.

C. Testing New Features:  Every couple of weeks someone comes up with an exciting innovation that everyone gets excited about. The trouble is no one actually implements it. A great example is the MEETZE-WOODS whippletree mechanism for adaptive grip. It only takes about 15 minutes to print one of these, and 15 minutes to integrate it into a hand. To date I haven't seen one implemented on a Rator. The best possible person to evaluate whether or not in adaptive grip is a useful feature is a real user who also has a hand without it. Why not make volunteers integrate this into their test hand and send it to recipient who already has a hand is functioning well?

D. Testing Hand Performance: In the near future, we will be testing hand for durability and functional performance with purpose built testing equipment. The hands used in the tests will need to come from somewhere!

Benefit to the Volunteer:

A. Practice Sizing a Hand to for a Recipient: One of the most difficult and challenging aspects of hand is actually fitting it to the user. Just printing a hand shaped test print doesn't prepare you for this. Volunteers should have the opportunity to try measuring a hand, scaling a hand, and using handomatic before they get a real recipient. Who better to validate that the maker is capable of fitting a hand properly than a recipient who already has a hand that fits well?

B. Real User Feedback: Volunteers will get real feedback from an experienced user on the the things they need to do to make better hands. Maybe the elastics were too tight. Maybe the fingers needed sanding. Maybe the Raptor wrist hinge wasn't at the user's wrist crease. This is important feedback for the volunteer to get before they make the first hand for a new recipient.

C. Engagement: Making a test hand is a ton of work. There is a real learning curve involved. Just the print time will be 20hrs. It's not terribly exciting to invest several dozen hours into a hand just to toss it in a shoebox under the bed. It's much more exciting for the volunteer to build a hand for a real child, secure in the knowledge that if they don't get it 100% perfect, the child has another hand. Would you rather print a paperweight, or a build a brand new prototype for a real child that might later be deployed to children all over the world?

Benefit to the Recipient:

Fun: Let's face it, it's fun to get new things. A big part of why E-nable is successful is that the hands are cool and fun. To keep kids engaged, it's not a bad idea for them to be getting a new hand every 6 months or so.

Getting Improved Hands Faster: It may take a child 2 years to outgrow a hand, but the pace of hand innovation is dramatically faster than this. The Raptor alone is on it's 3rd iteration after just 4 months of existence. Why should a kid wait 2 years to get the latest and greatest version?

Engagement and Compliance: Getting a new hand ever few months will keep kids engaged. It'll be exciting to try out a new hand, and show it off to their friends. This is likely to keep them engaged an using the hand. Additionally, it makes the child and their family part of E-nables growth and development; they're playing an important role in testing out new hands, and new features that other kid's across the world will get to enjoy in the future.

At any rate, that was the idea I had. Thoughts?

Looking at the Raptor and Cyborg Beast, one thing really stands out to me. The control cable for the thumb has to take a 90 degree bend. This generates an enormous amount of friction. It seems like a $0.25-$0.50 sealed bearing would solve the problem nicely and could be installed in 10 seconds or so with a single screw.

The thumb should be the strongest finger in the hand, because it's used in opposition to the other 4 fingers in gripping. Currently it's probably the weakest, because so much of it's strength is currently lost to friction taking that nasty 90 degree bend.

A $2.00 skateboard bearing is probably way over-engineered for the task. It's designed to take loads orders of magnitude higher than what a thumb would need, in much wetter, harsher conditions than the hand would experience. I would guess we could get a pretty good bearing for around 50 cents. Even just a 1 cent steel collar that rotates around a screw would be 10x better than what we're currently doing I think.

I saw some nice looking grooved bearings on ebay that are about the right size for 28 cents each. It seemed like a good deal, but I don't know much about bearings.

http://www.ebay.com/itm/10-624VV-4mm-V-Groove-Sealed-Guide-Pulley-Rail-Ball-Bearing-4x13x6mm-4-13-6-/170962467859

Has anyone ever tried using a bearing mounted by a screw, or a steel collar mounted by a screw on the thumb? Is it a good idea or a waste of time and money?

I'm guessing if it was a good idea, we'd already be doing it given how little it costs, and how easy it would be to install. What are the downsides?

https://plus.google.com/u/0/110736851786370579318/posts/DPtLShQCsw8,"Direct Drive Palm: Half Baked Idea of the Day

In an ordinary human palm, there is a fourth joint at the base of the palm as pointed out by +ELIZABETH JACKSON in a recent post. This is a fairly weak joint in a normal human hand as pointed out by +Nick Parker. For our e-nable hands however, this is actually the spot on the hand were we have the most potential power.

The reason for this is that this is the only point on the hand where we have a 1:1 leverage ratio. In the fingers, a great deal of power is lost to leverage and the leverage ratio might be more like 1:10. If you put 1Kg of force in wrist flexion, you get about 100grams in finger grip; most of the loss is to leverage. However when you push the human palm against a plate on Raptor palm, if you put 1kg of force from the palm against the plate, you get 1Kg of force against the plate (1:1). In other words, the power in the palm could be 1000% higher than in the fingers (rough guess, not measured results).

One way to capture this would be to put a flat PLA palm plate that screwed to the face of the palm. Two large bumps sit on the palm plate and can travel in and out of it on PLA pistons. When the palm is pushed against a push plate on the inside of the palm, the two hemispherical bumps rise up to meet the fingers.

This accomplishes 2 things:

1. The distance that the fingers need to travel to close is reduced. This is important because the amount of force that the fingers are able to generate is a direct function of the ratio string travel finger movement. Lower the finger travel while keeping the wrist flexion constant and you increase grip power.
2. You get a 1:1 force involved in gripping. This could make for a pretty powerful grip.

The pictures attached are very crude and exaggerated. I had about 20 minutes free and this was what I was able to do in Sketchup. The oogoo coated palm hemispheres wouldn't travel as much as pictured; I just wanted it to be clear that they were moving.

This idea was inspired by +ELIZABETH JACKSON  and +Gregg Dennison recent posts rethinking palms (Elizabeth) and leverage (Greg). The direct drive palm is pretty tangential to their ideas, which frankly are a lot more interesting and a lot better developed, but their posts are what got me thinking about this :)

At any rate, it's a half baked idea, but I think it's an intriguing one. What do folks think, could this be made to work? Would it even be useful?

Can't find the original post so I'm writing a new one

Your spring loaded tensioner has a lot of potential beyond the extra few mms of motion . Especially in the future when we start to use double jointed fingers. The hand could comfortably take the form ofwhatever its holding

If the spring deflection is around the same as the travel length of the tendons (open to close) then this adaptive grip could be achieved

I'm thinking an extension spring instead of compression might allow for a more compact design

The downside of running with this is
1. The grip strength will be equal to the rating of the spring
2. The spring selection will be on case by case basis (and changing even for the individual)

That being said, I feel like there might be a manner of calculating which spring to use

Would it be possible for example to measure the grip strength of the child's normal arm, derive the load on each finger from there and then calculate which spring to go with
Or would it be possible to do a study and define the spring based on sex and age groups?

It'd be nice to get some feedback from the experts in the group on this",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

There was a moment (or two) that we got off the intended topic. One of those times we touched on the functionality of the prosthesis. +Jorge Zuniga mentioned there were several psychological benefits of having the device beyond the ability to actually grasp things, which of course I think is great. But as an OT, I have to think about function. I wanted to give you a small insight into my experience of working with people who can only use one upper extremity and think about some functional tasks we could think about when designing the hand.

First off, let me say that you can live a completely independent life with the use of only one UE. The kids I work with who have prostheses that don't function well, will not use them. They will figure out a way to do things with one hand. In my opinion, if you want a kid to use the prosthesis, you have to make it worth their effort. It is highly unlikely that they will need to pick up something tiny on a table with their prosthesis, they are just going to use their fully functioning hand. 
Tasks that are made easier with two hands: zipping up a jacket, cutting with a fork and knife, opening/closing a baggy, opening a jar, doing dishes... etc.

Think about the grasp patterns that are needed for some of those activities. Zipping a jacket needs a pretty powerful lateral pinch, holding a fork to cut with a knife needs a stable gross grasp, etc. 
Most bilateral activities the ""helper hand"" is used for stability, not manipulation.

I'm sure that someone with an upper extremity reduction can speak to this even better, so please feel free to add to these thoughts.",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

The two problems that vex me the most about snap pins is that they tend to be a bit loose, and they're very rough. In fact, when you look at them with a magnifying glass, they look like tiny gears with teeth (linear striations) running the full length of the pin. In short, it's a pretty high friction surface.

You can do a acetone vapor bath to smooth them if they're ABS, but there isn't much you can do if they're PLA. You can sand them smooth, but since they're already a bit loose to begin with, it's pretty easy to sand them so loose that they fall right out of the fingers (don't ask me how I know!).

One thing I experimented with is painting them with epoxy glue from Home Depot ($5.00 for enough epoxy for 1000 pins). I just mixed up a tiny batch on a piece of cardboard, and paint the epoxy on a pin with a few bristles from an old paintbrush. When it's first mixed, it paints on in a light coat, and is thin enough to self level to a nice smooth surface. The best way to do it is to paint 1 side of all the pins, and stand them on their side with the epoxy side facing up so the epoxy levels into all of the gaps in the teeth. The epoxy sets fairly quickly, so there is just the right amount of time to paint 1 side of each pin. When the first side has set after a few minutes, I just flip them over and paint the other sides.

What I like about this is it gives a dramatically smoother surface to the pins, and the surface is significantly harder than the PLA, so it should wear quite well. I'm curious to try dipping a string in the epoxy and running it through the cable channels to see if this might lower friction and harden the insides of the cable channels as well. I use .5mm Dyneema line, so the holes are way oversized anyway.

I'm not sure if this is an especially good idea, and it's not for everyone, but if you'd like to try smoothing rough pins that are undersized to begin with, it's a plausible option. Probably best to print 2 sets of pins so if it doesn't go well, you've only lost 15 minutes and 50 cents worth of PLA filament :)

Has anyone else ever tried this?

Another brilliant solution from +Steve Wood, who originally suggested coating cotton fabric with Oogoo to reinforce it.

Taking a look at +Skip Meetze amazing new palm cushion from what looks like a printed 3d mold got me thinking about the best way to attach Oogoo to a palm.

The trouble with the stuff is that for all it's great properties, (elasticity, durability, etc) it has one big achilles heal which was pointed out by +Steve Wood :

1. Like most silicones and elastics, it'd incredibly durable until it is torn, or cut. Once cut, the cut propogates through the whole piece if you put it under tension. This is a problem because if you drill it to mechanically affix to something, because the hole becomes a very weak point in the structure

2. It's really trick to glue to it. Regular superglue won't stick to it. There are glues that apparently will, but they're not something you can get right off the shelf.

Looking at Skip's picture of his marvelous molded Oogoo palm got me to thinking about how to make a bombproof attachment method that would overcome the two limitations listed above. +Steve Wood suggested two solutions: coating cotton like you see here or maybe mixing bits of fiber would work ( I still haven't tried that, but it's a cool idea).

Then it hit me. I was a conveyor belt technician for a good part of my early 20's. If you're ever been to a supermarket, you've seen a conveyor belt. If you flipped it over, you would see that it's just rubber glued to several ply's of thick nylon fabric in a sandwich.

So I grabbed an old t-shirt to see if I could replicate this with Oogoo. I mixed up a batch with the following recipe:

3 tblsp type 1 silicone
1 tsp of 99.5% glycerine (costs $5.00 for 6oz at any drugstore)
1 tsp of cornstarch
1 tsp of cheap artist acrylic ($0.50 at Walmart)

I then spread the ogoo in a thin 2mm layer with my mixing spoon on top of a square of old t-shirt. The wet Oogoo soaked right through the fabric! Next, I laid a new cotton t-shirt square and repeated this process. I did a 4 ply lamination. Then I put a big blob of Oogoo on top of the whole mess and left it cure.

It worked!

Now, the fabric prevents the Oogoo from ripping or tearing. You can drill it, cut it, sew it etc. There are also a gazillion fabrics that might work better than old t-shirts.

Does anyone have a suggestion as to what kind of fabric might work best?

So here it is - the first official ""CREATE T.I.M.E. (Think. Imagine. Make. e-NABLE.)"" Challenge specifically designed to encourage kids to start tinkering but also to get you seasoned pros making some cool things for Luke and others to use in their daily lives!

Some prizes are up for grabs - nothing big - but something fun :) 

I want the biggest reward to be that more kids and young adults get to realize how awesome it feels to use their imaginations to make a difference in the lives of others.

Please participate and help make some fun things for these kids to use!

Here is a short video showing how the Raptor 1.0 fingers seem to get stuck at 90 degrees.

You can see that the force input starts at .25lbs and slowly climbs to .5lbs right up until the distal phalange becomes perpendicular to the proximal phalange. At this point, the force input on the scale spikes up over 1lb to break 90 degrees and the finger suddenly lurches forward, the force drops back to .5lbs or so and then slowly climbs up to 2lbs to fully close the finger.

Other folks like +Eric Griffin  and +Thierry Oquidam have described this sticking point, so it's not just this one hand. I thought it might be useful to videotape this happening and measure it with a scale.

This raises a few points:

1. We should tweak the fingers/cable routing to remove this sticking point in the fingers. The fingers should close smoothly.

2. It takes way too much force to fully close the fingers tightly against the palm. 2lbs is way to much force to close 1 finger. This is partially due to Hookes law and the lengthening of the elastic, but part of it is the cable routing and finger design. One thing worth pointing out is that the issue isn't insufficient attention to elastic tying. I spent 3 hours tweaking the elastic lengths to prestretch it the absolute minimum amount required to return the fingers to the open position. The fingers barely have enough elastic tension to open fully. If you've never spent 3hrs tweaking the elastic length with a spring scale accurate to 10 grams, it's likely that your own fingers require substantially more force to close!

3. It would be great to have tension adjustment for the elastics. If I had a choice between tension adjustment for the closing cables, (which we currently do with the Owen Tensioner) or tension adjustment for the elastics, I'd pick tension adjustment for the elastics. The Meetze adaptive grip mechanism somewhat addresses finger closing-cable length adjustment, but there is nothing that addresses elastic tension adjustment. It matters a lot!

I think we can safely say that +Andreas Bastian and +Laird Popkin have already done a years worth of work 3d modeling in the past month alone. Who else has some solid modeling skills and is interested in working on this?

About a month ago i got my first e-nable Job to build a RIT arm.  I contacted the family for color choices etc and we were all very excited.  A day or so later i was informed by the community that its best not to proceed due to current design flaws in the RIT -ARM and that new designs would shortly be available.  I informed the family of the delay.   I feel terrible for letting this family down and would like to know. 

1. Is there a better design available
2.  Will i receive support from the community for going ahead with the current model.  
3.  I have heard from people the current arm is warmly received...are the design faults serious?  What are they?
3.  When will the new design be ready.

I am keen to print the arm and send it off with a promise of a better one in the future.  How does this sound?

Thanks in advance.

One of the things I've been curious about is whether or not it's possible to neutralize the acetic acid (vinegar) that is the byproduct of type 1 silicone when it cures. Oogoo gives off a strong vinegar smell while it cures, and the scent though faint, persists for many days even after it's cured. Although the acetic acid is very weak, the smell is annoying and it could be a skin irritant.

My solution was to mix baking soda in with the cornstarch. Baking soda is a weak base and that vinegar is a weak acid. When you mix them, you get Carbon Dioxide and Water. Since the silicone is water curing, in theory, you should get a ph balanced oogoo that cures even faster with a neutral ph and a slightly lower durometer from trapped carbon dioxide bubbles.

I think it worked!

I haven't figured out a way to test the Ph yet, but the vinegar smell is totally gone after just 24hrs! I added a ton of baking soda though, so the oogoo is a bit gritty and too soft. Still, I think I neutralized the Ph while keeping the whole mix food safe which might come in handy.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

For now, I have changed the proximal phalange just a wee bit to allow the use of flexible filament for the ""tendons"". I am using Taulman PTFE, a nylon coplymer, that is remarkably flexible yet does not stretch. This, so far, does three things: vastly simplifies assembly; eliminates the need for elastics as it can both push and pull with the ability to return to position as the wrist is straightened; allows for a more complete overlapping closure of thumb and fingers for better gripping characteristics.
Nylon can be tough to print, but this latest from Taulman does OK when used with glue stick and brim. It also incorporates all of the other useful characteristics of nylon: easily dyed any color, can be anti-microbial infused; has a soft touch feel to the material and a natural lubricity that allows for a smooth, non-greasy operation. 
I am trying out all of the parts of a complete hand to see which are best suited to this material.

Which gripping pattern is the most useful? It's an interesting question, especially if you're limited to just 1 or 2 grip patterns on an e-nable hand. I've been scouring old journal articles to see what research has been done to classify grip pattern usage frequency in daily life.

One of the best articles that I've come across is ""Sollerman Hand Function Test"" by Christer Sollerman and Arvid Ejeskar, published in the Scandanavian Journal of Reconstructive Surgery.

Here is a screenshot of the article where it lists 8 grip patterns and the relative frequency of use of each based on their research. +Adam Arabian posted some interesting points regarding grip patterns and I thought he and others might be interested to see what Sollerman's research showed. Since +Skip Meetze has figured out how to do a multi-position thumb, I thought he might be interested as well.

I'd post the full article, but I don't have a clue how to do that in Google+, so I'm just posting a pic of the page that has the table (bottom left hand corner).

If anyone else has any articles regarding grip pattern frequency in activities of daily living, let me know. I'd love to see it!

I have run into a number of issues with the bungee cords that return the fingers to a straight position when not flexed.  I am wondering if others have run into these same issues.  I have solutions I have started to implement, but I am not convinced they are the best possible.  So I am also wondering if anyone has other possible solutions.

First the issues.  I started out with a bungee with a knot in one end threading down through a finger, then through holes in the knuckle block, then back up the neighboring finger - pulled tight and another knot to hold it all in place.  My problems with this (as I understand it, fairly standard setup) stem at least in part from the fact that this is an adult hand with relatively long fingers, and I have made them match actual finger lengths (so they are not all the same).  Because the fingers are long, the tension on the bungees needs to be relatively high, or they will not return to the straight position.  When the tension is high, however, the bungees tend to pull into the holes in the finger tips - the knots won't stop them.  Also, using one bungee for two fingers means the return tension on each is the same.  When the fingers are different lengths, this doesn't work.  A tension strong enough to return a short finger, leaves a longer neighbor sagging.  Tighten enough to hold the longer finger, and the shorter one is so tight that it does not want to bend at all.

Now my solutions - which might be incredibly suboptimal, but I wanted to get out there for discussion... 

For the first problem, I used a separate bungee cord for each finger.  I tied a simple slip knot in the end, and looped it around the finger tip.  I then drew it tight with the ends positioned so that the knot sits in the string hole.  There will eventually be string wrap over the tip, with superglue holding that, and then everything past the bungee loop will be dipped in rubber.  I think this part of the solution is actually pretty good.  The bungee is completely unable to move - the end being very securely locked in place.  The string/glue/rubber should help further hold and protect the loop around the finger.  In fact, the slight bump the loop adds might even give a minor improvement to grip.  That all said, I would be interested if anyone sees any issues with this. solution.

Now the part about which I am most concerned.  Because I have a separate bungee for each finger, I now need a way to secure them, under tension.  What I did was to add four small holes to the knuckle block.  I bring each bungee through the knuckle block as normal, and then go through the new hole and do a simple knot.  I am able to set the tension on each bungee individually - so that all of them return to straight and each takes about the same force to curl.  I have let the hand sit for about a week, and the bungees did not seem to lose tension.  That, however, is my fear.  The knot I am using is very simple, and I am not convinced that it will not just slowly loosen and release.  The space makes it very hard to tie a really good knot, and the fact that this is elastic rather than normal string/rope makes almost all knots questionable anyway.  There is not a lot of room on the knuckle block, so it is difficult to make clamping terminals, or anything like that.  Anyone have any thoughts on this?  Any better ideas?  I really am a bit uncomfortable with how this is going to hold up.  If there is a better solution, I would rather figure it out before I finish up the fingertips.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+FrankieFlood/posts/8XpiqtdYhHa,"I thought I would post some pics of the mold making process that my team of students is experimenting with. I had noticed that +Nick Parker is getting ready to make molds for some finger parts and I realize that he will most likely 3D print his molds, but regardless I thought our processes might be helpful to others. The molds are being made to cast parts at a specific scale, but when or if we make multiple hands at a specific scale this will be useful. We can make molds for one, two or even three different scale hands and then easily and rapidly create hand components. My team usually makes at least two hands for each child that we create hands for (so they have a ""back-up hand"") and this will allow us to make molds for whatever scale hand we happen to make a hand for. Soon we can build a library of molds that we can use when we get requests and we can pull those molds and cast parts from these to save on time. Alternatively, we can cast base hand models to experiment with and stress test with less of a time investment in the printing time. Printer upkeep and use goes down due to the number of hands we are printing.

In this case I used my son's legos to build mold boxes. This allows for irregular shaped molds and conserves on mold making materials which can be expensive. The mold box is built and the bottom of the box is lined with clay at the thickness that you want your mold half to be. It should be thick enough to hold it's shape as a final mold half without needing a mother mold surround (usually at least 1/2"" thick in this particular Smooth-On Rio Flex material). The printed part is imbedded half way into the clay, dimples are placed in the clay to act as ""keys"" for the mold halves to align properly, and then everything is sprayed with mold release. The RioFlex parts are mixed and then poured into the mold. The mold material solidifies and then it is flipped over, clay removed, and a small sprue or cylinder is added to the printed part as a future ""pour spout"". The other half of the mold sprayed with mold release. The RioFlex parts are mixed and poured for the other half of the mold. Once this solidifies, the original printed part can be removed by pulling the two mold halves apart and your'e ready to mix plastic and pour the part. The ""sprue"" can be trimmed from the part and now you can put your part into use.

For complex parts with internal passage ways, we plan on using metal rods or wire as ""core Pins"" that are cast in place inside the passage ways of the printed parts. these core pins extend outside the passageways and into the mold. Each time the mold is poured with plastic the core pins are put into place inside the mold halves and later pulled out of the cast part leaving an open passageway.

I know this diverts from the 3D printing focus of what we are doing (in some ways), but I have to ask myself what the next step is in providing hands for people in need. This is something that we're exploring here in the DCRL and we'll keep posted on our progress.

The components are used in casts, orthotics, prostehtic sockets, braces, etc.

The person I have been in contact with is Jimmy Capra, he told to expect a price somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 per tensioner, more expensive than the screw tensioner, but easier for the end user  to adjust/service if needed (I assume). It also opens a lot of possibilities. I will suggest that Jimmy join the group to see if he might be able to provide some incite from his experience working with manufacturers to develop mass produced devices using the BOA system.

I am so happy to find a group of like minded people looking to lend a hand. I bought an Anet A8 about two months ago to model parts for my R/C hobby. I am new to the world of 3D printing but I've had great success with my prints so far. My success reminded me of a story I read around 7 years ago about an engineer who traveled to Africa with a 3D printer to print limbs for victims of civil  war.

The other two are regular 120% LH and RH but while printing the RH model my thermistor worked partially out of its pit in the hot end.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/110736851786370579318/posts/athSfUKnkSR,"Grip Strength Measurement Project:

I'm working on a project to measure the grip strength of the Raptor, Cyborg Beast, and Talon hands and I need some help. I need some thoughts on what methodology is going to give the best measurements at the lowest cost. I'd like to get a dozen or so testers, preferably actual recipients to perform the measurements. Here are some options I've thought of:

Measuring Methodology:

Option 1: Occupational Therapist Dynamometer: Ideally, recipients should be under the care of an occupational therapist in using the hands. These practitioners will likely have access to  well calibrated, professional quality tools to measure the grip strength of the hands. A standardized methodology for measurement would be established to ensure consistency of the measurements.

Option 2. Economy Hand Dynamometer ($28): http://www.amazon.com/Camry-Electronic-Hand-Dynamometer-Strength/dp/B005EPKXXA/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1412351691&sr=1-1&keywords=dynamometer

The hand dynaometer is placed in the hand in the nearly closed position and the user squeezes the grip closed to measure grip strength. Max grip strength is automatically recorded and digitally displayed.

Problem: I'm guessing the grip strength of the average user is less than 1kg. The equipment may not be accurate at these low grip strengths.

Option 3. Spring Scale ($5.30: http://www.amazon.com/Ajax-Scientific-Spring-Balance-Capacity/dp/B00EPQGMF2/ref=pd_sbs_indust_7?ie=UTF8&refRID=1ZHBYAANN095JPG5MR0A

Grip Measurement: A finger trapeze would be made with a pencil and two pieces of string (the same non-stretching spectra cord we use for the fingers). The two pieces of string would be tied to each end of the pencil, and then to one another. This would create a triangle. The two pieces of string would be hitched to the hook of the spring scale. The Mounting ring of of the spring scale would be affixed to an immovable object like a wall, desktop, etc. The user would start the measurement in the fully open position. Keeping the wrist and forearm immobilized, the user would close the fingers and read the maximum reading on the scale. Three measurements of this would be made and the results averaged.

Problem: If the travel of the spring in the scale is too long, the finger would close before a maximum reading could be taken. I don't think the average user will be able to create more than 0.5 kg of grip strength, so using a 3kg scale should minimize the travel but still provide 40 gram resolution.

Option 4: Food Scale ($15.00): http://www.amazon.com/EatSmart-Precision-Digital-Kitchen-Silver/dp/B001N07KUE/ref=sr_1_3?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1412351876&sr=1-3&keywords=food+scale

The user would grip this in the hand in the fully closed position and take the reading from the scale.

Problem: Most digital scales take time to read, and may not get a reading if the weight/force is variable. Mechanical scales that I've seen tend to be quite large, and the wrong shape to work in this application.

I'd love to hear what you think might work, or additional problems with the ideas listed above.

I'm also part of a French community for children and adult with different kinds of dysmelia. A lot of girls and boys in this association would love to have the same robot-hands than Alexis but, often, they are not speaking English and experiences difficulties to fill in the form.
I have then translated it in French and I would like to know to whom I can send it to make it available for all future French people who would visit the e-NABLE web site.
Any idea?

I just  filled out Jen's Year-in-Review questionaire, and urge you to do it too!
https://plus.google.com/u/0/115810399850545696521/posts/KAxUfAPdVQf?sfc=true

Here's some of what I wrote...

It's been a year of transition and activity.  I resigned from the Enable Community Foundation.  and I retire (today!) from Rochester Institute of Technology.  Skip Meetze and I closed the RIT MAGIC ACT/e-NABLE lab  this month, and next month we'll open the Rochester e-NABLE Lab at Vertus High School (and at Re-NABLE.org). 

And yet, 2016 has also been productive both locally and globally.  Lacally, Skip has made huge progress on the wireless gripper thumb hand (released) and arm (in progress) and we have hopes it can be be simpler, more functional, robust and attractive than current e-NABLE solutions for trans-humeral trans-radial amputees.  We've done our share of makerfaires and local presentations, and mentored a few dozen RIT students, a couple  of whom will be working in the new Re-NABLE lab.

Globally, I gave presentations on e-NABLE in New York City, Washington DC and Washington State, Rome, Cairo, Alexandria, Haifa, Tel Aviv, Dubai.  I also published a couple of whitepaper on Technologies for Empowering Effective Mobs, academic papers about e-NABLE.  see https://workflowy.com/s/EiAK.12lFfNhYKs#/?q=2016

All this bodes well for e-NABLE in 2017, and for an emerging ""Connected Humanitarians"" alliance with several other organizations.  (Connected Humanitarianism is e-NABLE generalized: not just 3D printing, not just prosthetics.  Volunteers using online collaboration, open-source methodologies,  and emerging technologies to help underserved populations worldwide.)  Between now and June, I expect to be doing relevant work in Dubai, India, South Africa, and elsewhere. see https://workflowy.com/s/EiAK.12lFfNhYKs#/?q=2017

Biggest challenges:  
Diplomacy (relationships between ECF, RIT, e-NABLE community) and sustainability (funding the lab, paying the bills).  

What can the community do to help?
Take initiative, take responsibility, follow through, honor the e-NABLE code of conduct, keep doing amazing work, keep telling us all about it.

(Telling us about it in a post is not a substitute for filling out Jen's form.  She'll do something great with it, as usual.  Here's her invitation post:

Looking at the approaches to getting grip on a finger/palm I suddenly thought of this idea.

Why not use the squishable nature of the flex filaments and push them into a groove - so I tried it and it works really well.

Would probably be even better with a lower shore flex as ninjaflex is 80+

Printed best on its back - but you just print a 3mm hole that is cut to leave just enough room to push in the flex to hold it!

I put ends on this one to show it could be quite neat.

In this design, the hinge point can be further away from the tendon lines, which is great for grip strength and ease of actuation, however, more tendon travel would be required for the closing of the finger (especially with 3 joints) and therefore more wrist flexion is required.

This might be beneficial for the Limbitless Solutions style arms, because more grip strength from smaller servos, and it might be good for users with a large range of wrist movement too.

For those recipients with a small movement range, who thinks it would be better to have a two jointed finger with the distal phalange slightly kinked like the e-NABLE hands, or to have the tendon lines closer to the hinge point? Both options will use less movement to actuate.

When I close the hands I've made, the fingertips close much later than the the knuckle joints. It feels like there's a huge amount of resistance as the elastic cord runs over the tip of the proximal joint. It feels like the elastic is caught at that point and doesn't move at all until the first joint is almost maxed out.

What if there were a round pin at the end of the proximal joint? It wouldn't even need to be a snap pin, the sides would be enclosed in the figertips, even when the finger is closed, so a simple cylinder wouldn't slip out. I think the 100% hand has enough room for a small but reasonable pin. Plus, it would have plenty of support from both sides to keep the part solid.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/110736851786370579318/posts/VP9hEYBxvLy,"The e-NABLE Prosthetic Utility Framework and an X-Prize Competition:

One thing that I've been thinking a lot about recently is how to align prosthetic utility with the future hand design innovations. The existing designs are remarkable, and they're getting even better. One thing that I think that can be really helpful in aligning new hand designs with usefullness for user's is developing an e-NABLE framework/criteria for prosthetic utility.

If we have something as simple as a set of 10 measurable criteria that hands can be judged against, it will be possible to benchmark existing designs, and evaluate future innovations. The criteria should be aligned with actual usefulness for users. Consider this simple example using 10 criteria:

1. Maximum Grip Strength: Measured by actual hand dynamometer measured maximum grip strength by the evaluator. The variability of actual user grip strength is accounted for by the same evaluator using existing hand models to compare measured grip strength between models. The score on this could be on a scale of 1 to 10, with a 1kg grip being a score of 1, and a 10kg grip being a score of 10. Current hands might be at a 1 right now.

2. Pincer Grip Ability: Measured by how many marbles of varying size (out of 60 marbles) the user can pick up out of a bowl, and place them in an adjacent bowl in 60 seconds. The more marbles that can be picked up, the better the hand. A score of 1 would be less than 5 marbles, and a score of 10 would be 60 marbles.

3. Average Grip Strength: Measured by the grip strength measured on a hand dynamometer at 20 second intervals for 5 minutes. This measures the efficiency of the of the grip. A normally closed hand would excel in this test, whereas a normally open design would have more difficulty. An average grip strength of 1kg would would be a score of 1, and an average score of 10kg would be a score of 10.

4. Pinch Grip Strength Adjustability: This test would require the user to alternate between picking a grape out of a bowl unharmed, and squishing a 1cm ball of silly putty flat in 60 seconds. 20 Grapes and 20 silly putty spheres. A score of 1 would be less than 5 of each, a score of 10 would be all 20 grapes and all 20 spheres flat.

5. Grasping Adjustability: This test would require the user to pick up various household objects and move them from one tray to another. The objects could be a can of soup, a 5lb barbell, a pencil, a washer, a magazine, a paperclip, kitchen knife, a roll toilet paper etc. A score of 1 would be 5 movements, a score of 10 would be 60 movements.

6. Durability: Measured by taping a brick around the palm of the hand, and dropping it from increasing height in 1 foot increments. The hand is dropped until no longer functional. A score of 1 might be a 4 foot maximum drop, as score of 10 might be a drop from 10 feet.

7. Cost: Measured by the total cost to produce the hand including filament, hardware, and fasteners. A score of 1 would be $200, and a score of 10 would be $25.

8. Ease of Assembly: Measured by total assembly time based on user provided instructions for a hand with a palm of 50mm by 80mm. A score of 1 would be 3 hours, and a score of 10 would be 30 minutes.

9. Eating and Writing Facility: The hand would alternate between lifting a fork and spearing a grape, and lifting up a pencil and writing the word e-nable legibly in 60 seconds. A score of 1 would be 2 of each, a score of 10 would would be 20 grapes and 20 words.

10. Aesthetics: Measured by how many seconds an 8 year old child can resist picking up the hand and trying it on. A score of 1 would be the child hiding it under a napkin, a score of 10 would be the child putting it on in under 5 seconds. This isn't really a very good test, but I ran out of ideas :)

The objective would be to have a total point score for each hand. The Raptor might have a score of 15 today if we ran the test. The goal is to get a hand with a score of 100.

The results of the tests would be published on the e-nable website for each hand. A score board would be created to keep track of which individuals were making the greatest contribution to making our dream hand. This could be incredibly powerful in and of itself.

People are naturally competitive. Engineering schools are even moreso. Right now, I think there's a good bet that RIT and Creighton would be able to produce a pretty high score. I think Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Cal Tech might find it galling not to outdo them. Steve Woods and Aaron Brown working alone might keep both institutions on their toes with their amazing contributions. If we could harness the brilliance and energy that Robotics competitions engender, we could achieve amazing things.

This would be an ongoing competition, and not an annual event. The challenge with an annual competition is that people procrastinate. This would be an open competition, with submissions possible at any time. If a team had a hand that they believe could increase the cumulative score above the existing benchmark hand by 5 points, they could submit it immediately for evaluation. This would create a sense of urgency to submit innovations quickly before another team does. The new high scoring hand would be become the new benchmark hand. You would need to outdo it by 5 points to submit a hand for evaluation. This would force teams shy of the 5 point mark to collaborate with other teams also just shy of the mark to combine their innovations. That's a good thing!

If we really wanted to get fancy, we could endow the competition with $100,000. Each point of increased utility (out of a possible 100) would receive a $1,000 research grant. The purpose would be to reward amazing innovation and productivity with additional funding to buy software licenses, upgrade equipment, and to invest in new materials and experimentation.

Regardless of whether or not money was involved, the framework above would be tremendously powerful. It would align actual user utility with the score for the hands. Designers could easily see what hands are currently doing poorly, and what they should be doing better. A great example is a functioning pincer grip with an opposable thumb. We have dozens of brilliant designers, but only Skip Meetze is working on one as far as I know. Just that innovation alone will bring untold usefulness to our recipients. The scoring matrix above heavily weights the score of the hand to it's ability to perform this vitally useful operation.

Naturally, work will need to be done in order to align prosthetic utility with the scoring matrix and tasks. At this point, we haven't done enough work thinking about what will make our hand the most useful. Here is a paper highlighting all research into prosthetic utility measurements done from 1970 to 2009. I'd say that's a pretty good starting point.

What Does Google+ Mean To You?

This is one of my famous ""very long reads"" so take your time with it and pace yourself!

A few years back, I had a lofty goal in mind to write a book about mastering Google+ and providing insights into how I was able to navigate the waters of this UI. I live on a rural farm in NW Ohio and somehow I've gathered 55,000 followers and 32 million views of my posts, so it feels like I'm doing a few things right. I had about 45 pages written, but life, being unemployed for a lengthy time, then finally finding great new work intervened and this book is now collecting dust in Drive.

But I did reach out to many incredible people on G+ and I asked them one simple question: What does Google+ mean to you?

I hope they won't mind if I share their stories here. I don't want their words to disappear to time, and until I finish this book (and I will!) I thought my circles might enjoy seeing their thoughts. I'd love to hear from them all now and see if anything's changed or gotten better. This is a great journey we're all on...

If you'd like to add your own extended words on this topic, comment here of PM me and I'll be sure you're added. Also, if any of these authors no longer would like to have their words publicly posted in the stream, I'll respect your wishes and remove your words. But each response was lovely and I hope my readers enjoy seeing where all of our collective heads were when I asked the question...

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Paul Roustan - Providence, Rhode Island, USA +Paul Roustan 

Google+ has been, by far, the best means for me to showcase my work. More importantly, it is a platform allowing me to develop relationships with people of all sorts, be it friendships, colleagues, and/or valuable connections for my artwork. I don't think there is any better method to connect to an important person, the right person, bypassing their agency/secretary/bodyguard or whoever would normally deny contact. This is a TREMENDOUS benefit to artists/musicians/directors/etc. Google+ cuts out the middle man, allowing many people to exist that may never have been found.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Stephanie Van Pelt - Florida, USA +Stephanie Van Pelt 

Sometimes technology has a way of touching us in the most unexpected ways.

I joined Google Plus during its infancy, within the first month during the throttled-invite-only phase. I must confess, I was courted more by the exclusivity of it all than because I was so very anxious to join another social network. All I knew was that you had to be invited and that it was only 1 week old.

It took me only a week or so to drum up the courage to join a Hangout, a feature that allows you to video chat with up to 9 other people from pretty much anywhere. It was scary, my palms were sweaty and they were complete strangers. In fact, everyone I interacted with on Google Plus was a stranger. And yet, there we were, saying hello, responding to posts and exchanging ideas down threads of conversation.

I really had no idea what was in store for me. None. If you told me then where I’d be now, I would have said you’re insane.

Once I recovered from the initial nervousness I realized everyone else was in the same predicament. Some hid it better than others, or were just inherently more comfortable with the medium; however Google Plus was too new for anyone to be established at Hangouts. As the comfort level grew, so did my enjoyment and love of Hangouts.

As a single mom, I don’t get out much these days. The boys are in bed early but I am up for hours still, a night owl and social by my very nature. Hangouts give me the opportunity to connect with people from all over the world, to sit up late at night and converse, argue, debate, listen to music, explore the internet and ultimately forge some incredible new connections and relationships.

Over the past 6 months I’ve been able to broaden my horizons in fantastic ways. I was introduced to dubstep (yes, I know!) through a music Hangout. I’ve gotten to know more about the remarkable differences and intriguing traditions of other cultures through direct chat with strangers I may never see or meet. I’ve randomly helped a few strangers through small donations. I’ve seen exotic locations through mobile Hangouts and had discussions on everything from food to health care to love won (and lost) .

There have been some incredible, personal stories shared with me. Some publicly in comments on threads and some far more privately. I’m always touched when virtual strangers open up and tell me more about what makes them, them.

After posing a question, what book really seized your imagination and got you to start reading I was astounded at some of the deep answers shared with me. Behind the curtain of a monitor people shared parts of themselves few people share face to face. I read about one person using books to fulfill the role models they never received from their own parents; another shared his personal work experience with one of my favorite authors.

Similar stories, moving and emotional came after a post about dating single parents. I cherish each time people shared themselves with me. Everything from a mother’s death, to the loss of a twin, to surviving childhood cancer, to orphaned adults alone for the holidays…job loss, promotions!, gift exchanges, sharing of that one little link you know will matter to someone, exposure to new music – so much to explore, but all of it in a very personal matter.

What this has really boiled down to, for me, is that all those random, strange “internet people” have become so much more. Connecting through common interests rather than common locations, I feel like I’ve had this amazing opportunity to explore the people that make up the internet.

So what happened to me? I wound  up on a cruise with some of those “internet people” and had the absolute time of my life. I challenge you , who’s out there waiting for you to get to know them? Who haven’t you met yet? What haven’t you learned about yet?

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Liz Quilty - Cambridge, New Zealand +Liz Quilty 

Google+ has meant a lot to me, it’s enabled me to connect to like minded people who are not always the majority. Being a female in technology means i work and live in a very male orientated world, though i don’t think that this is necessarily a bad thing. 

However, i would have liked to meet more females in the industry and be able to help us promote each other, to get more voice and encourage other females who are looking to get into things. Being able to interact with those people, and helping organize things like +STEM Women on G+ has been amazingly awesome.

Google is actively helping us with our task, and this in itself is what is setting it apart from other social media platforms. Google have done this with several other groups and people, and especially minority groups with a good cause have found a voice. 

For this reason, Google+ has changed my life, and the life of a lot of others in a similar way :) For me, Google+ is support, supporting those who want to help themselves go places, and do things :) Its also friendship, and great conversation, i have got a LOT from a lot of great people!

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Michael Vaughan - Mackay, Queensland, Australia +Michael Vaughan 

My first motivation for using Google+ was that it was not Facebook.  At the time Google+ was announced, I was still futilely trying to convince people to use Orkut. Google+, for me, hasn't become the Facebook-killer I'd hoped, because so few people I know in meatspace use it, however I've met so many cool people here.  I think this must be what it felt like for those first internet users, with their wholly new online communities, BBSs and such.

Possibly the thing I like most about Google+, though, aside from the features, is just how accessible the semi-famous can be.  Bloggers, artists, authors, actors; at some point, I've actually exchanged words with people I've looked up to for so long, and that is what keeps me using it.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Daf Griffiths - Ponciau, Wales, United Kingdom +Daf Griffiths 

G+ has been a big boost for me, if you met me face to face you would instantly turn to one of my friends and say the same thing everybody else does: ""this guy is hard work to talk to""!

I used to be the type of person who lived for the attention on stage. I always took great pleasure from compliments about my performance in musicals as it meant I'd done my work right, and by doing it right I mean I wasn't me for 3 hours. My greatest pleasure in life was rehearsing for 4 months of the year to not be me for 3 hours a night over the space of a week and that week was the highlight of my year,

NOW, every day is a highlight as G+ has allowed me to be myself without having to come face to face with people in difficult environments and it's incredibly liberating! I aim to join in with hangouts soon and that will be a major turning point for me, but with the friends that I've made on here I'm not worried about the outcome as I already trust those people implicitly.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of jay dawge - Maine, USA +jay dawge 

OK here goes, Google plus came along at a time when things were quite mixed up. I was having a really hard time finding work, so I sold my home and moved south for a job offer that paid better. The move brought me closer to my daughters home +kool cat so the move was a no brainer. I did not know anybody down here and I met my roommate the same day I moved down. I worked a lot and had no friends here, so google plus was a good escape. I have met so many cool people doing so many cool things in so many cool places, that I don't know how I would get by w/o them. G+ also gives me a way to share cool music, pictures, stories and art with my daughter ""and many others around the world for that matter"".

Using this brilliant and fantastic technology through blog posts, comments, debates, images, sound and hangouts, incredible people, virtual pioneers of a new world, have offered and shared the best of themselves, their knowledge and experience to enhance our human experience.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Stefan Svartling - Nycöping, Sweden +Stefan Svartling 

Google+ has the most interaction I've ever seen, so when it came, I'll immediately stopped blogging on my old normal blogs, and started to use Google+ as my main blog. My only blog. Why not blog where the interaction is was my thoughts, and I have never looked back.

So to me Google+ means everything. I love Google+ and all the interaction. It's my home online.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of David Bowden - Santa Monica, California, USA +David Bowden 

The answer to your question is simple really (for me anyway). I came to Google+ to share photography. Unlike many digital photographers I tend to shoot as I did in film. Meaning, I take a moment to compose, measure and shoot. I don’t use the back of the camera much, I tend to focus on what I see in the viewfinder and my overall composition.

What this means is that I don/t take as many pictures as others do. I also have a standard that I don't share ""crap."" If I am going to put my name on it then it needs to be good.

What does this have to do with my best moment on G+. Well, this set of circumstances is what led to my writing. You see, I ran out of photos to share. Being focused on growing my following I decided to share a story as opposed to a photo.

It led to the post ""A Good Day"" which is to date one of my most popular shares and most read and commented posts.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/112022983294967948367/posts/aXWLMoXhwLr

It was on this Wednesday that people began following me in larger numbers, commenting and engaging more and the stories followed. Week after week. Sharing this story and reading the comments and seeing the shares associated with it are by far my best experience on G+ and is what keeps me coming back.

I have some very loyal followers, great friends and enjoy the community. Good luck with your book, and thanks so much for thinking of me.

What Google Means to Me, and More Importantly, Why the Hell Should You Care? +Sean Cowen here ya go!

Oh sure, I could tell you about how I happened upon Google Plus through Facebook and Twitter, thereby making the obligatory comparisons to both social networks, eventually giving Google Plus the nickname ""TwitBook"".  Or I could tell you that I was instantly impressed with the social network for a number of reasons - 1) no stalkers 2) no Zynga invites and most importantly, 3) did I mention ""no stalkers""?

I could tell you all that, but if you're reading this, you've probably realized that I just told you.  So there ya go.

Google Plus, short of the invention of sliced bread and Velcro, is a true miracle, and has become a daily addiction of mine.  A place where I can share my musings with people who will either appreciate them, or in some cases, report me to Google.  (I'm guessing my recipe for ""sliced Velcro bread"" didn't trend like I hoped)

I have made a number of valuable friends on Google Plus, most with the same twisted sense of humor.  Outside of most national sanitariums, people like that are a true rarity, so yay!

Google Plus gives me a place to be who I am, with people who appreciate who I am, and in turn I appreciate them for being who they are.  Except for that one guy - he's just wacko.

I just happened to jump into the social network world when the water was still cold, and since I joined Google Plus, my nipples have never been happier.

So here's to you Google Plus!  From movie riffing hangouts to shameless self-promotion, I can think of no better social network.  Facebook and Twitter may have a lot of pluses (ha! see what I did there?), but Google Plus will always be the reason I love social networks.

Oh, and stalking?  Still the reason I hate them.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Joel Poirier - Ottawa, Ontario, Canada +Joel Poirier 

I joined Google+ out of curiosity in the early weeks of its launch and found a strong comics and art community already thriving. For a while I went relatively unnoticed: I'm not an exceptionally sociable person in my real life, I don't find it easy to meet new people, but through sharing my artwork I found people who were just like me and that made it easier to come out of my shell. 

I persisted in sharing my art and my interests through my comics, my drawings of album covers from my vinyl record collection and eventually creating, quite spontaneously, the Name That 80s Movie game, which has become my greatest social media success. Here I am now, just over a year later, and I'm in hundreds of thousands of circles with my work be seen all over the world, thousands more adding me every day, all because I share about the things that make me happy. Success is waiting here for anyone! ""

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Martin Watson - Spanish Town, Jamaica +Martin Watson 

I don't have much to say though. Not much other than that G+ is the first social network I actually wanted to join. On all the others that I've ever existed, I was, in a sense, dragged onto them kicking and screaming. I first found out about G+ on the day the invite only public field beta had just started. After much begging and pleading to any and everyone that I knew was on here, I managed to get in just before midnight on July 3 in the first week.

Since then, everything for me changed. The biggest change for me is that I've suddenly become more social. This is very strange for me, because I'm an extremely antisocial person. To an extent, I still am in real life. On here, however, I'm almost a different person. I can't explain it. I have absolutely no idea how that happened.

I have also met some of the most amazing people ever, large, small, and somewhere in between. In a sense, how big or small you are didn't matter here, because it's almost a level playing field for everyone. I still get super nervous and surprised whenever someone like +Mike Elgan mentions me in a post of his that I commented on.

Speaking of surprise and extreme nervousness, something of the sort happened earlier this year that almost made my heart stop. It was while we were all in an uproar about CISPA, with SOPA/PIPA and ACTA all still fresh in our minds. I had posted the contents of a mass email from someone at Demand Progress. It was a very passionate and moving message. Mere minutes after posting it, I was contacted by an extremely big name in the tech media space. (I won't mention her name here, but if you really want to know I'll tell you privately. I'm still in shock from all this even though it was months ago.) She asked me to write a commentary on CISPA. A commentary? Me? I'm supposed to write something about CISPA?! Me? Seriously? What the hell do I know? I don't even live in the US! I was in so much shock that I didn't even know to respond! I was surprised she contacted me in the first place!

After calming down, I eventually wrote something. I had a friend that was a writer and a friend that wasn't review it. They both liked it, so I sent it to her. I heard nothing at all from her since, and I hadn't seen it posted or mentioned anywhere at all. Not on her blog, her publication that she was building with other tech media giants, not on Twitter or G+. After a week of not seeing anything, I just assumed she either didn't need it anymore, it slipped through the cracks, or that it wasn't good enough. She is an extremely busy woman, so I understand if she didn't have much time to waste on lowly me.

It was all still an amazing and nerve racking experience though. It was my first time dealing with someone as high profile, prominent and successful and her. No wonder I was so scared. If it happened again, I would be better prepared to handle it, but I would still be scared out of my skin!

In addition to all that, I have somewhat found a sort of extended family on G+. I have a second mother on here, a few sisters I can actually get along with (only my own sister in real life), and other extremely amazing people that would find very difficult to now live without. Funny thing though, through all this, I've only ever been in a handful of hangouts. It's the only feature of G+, aside from Games, that rarely ever use. The few I've been in were all really great though. :)

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Pam Adger - Riverside, California, USA +Pam Adger 

My first public post was July 19th 2011. I came home from work and was talking to my daughter Sydney about this new social network by Google called Google Plus. I was lamenting that the thing was invite only and I was dying to get an invite. She then proceeded to tell me she had a “membership to the Google Plus club.” She said…..Mom, I know all about G+. My friend Kim invited me two weeks ago.  So with membership comes invites so I got an invite from my 18 year old daughter who to this day has less than 100 followers. I immediately posted the following 

Trying out some recommended follows. So far I am underwhelmed. Self promotion and immaturity. I wish I had a better list of recommendations.

I think it was 3 or 4 weeks before the suggested Users List (SUL) was released. It kinda needs a little work still.  In the beginning I was all about politics. That lasted about a month. I rarely post political now. I have found a great group of people. G+ is my second social network. Facebook was first and I still have my settings pretty locked down though I do post public and people could subscribe to me but they don’t. 35 or 40 IRL people (except Matt Gibson and Tim Jones) are my “friends.” Most are my family and coworkers and I can go weeks without logging on. G+ was something I took to right away. Almost instant chat with people from around the world? Holy Crap how awesome is that?????

One year later, I still spend between 4 and 6 hours per day every day including weekends and holidays on G+. It is really more of my life than I would like. 

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Dolidh Young (Eileen)  - Denny, Scotland, United Kingdom +Dolidh Young 

I started off my G+ life in beta... A time that was very difficult for me as I'd lost my father to cancer the year before and I was still grieving pretty badly. Focusing on putting positive energy into something gave me a push to get social again and not just spending my time moping about the house.

And in turn, by being more interested in doing things, I started to get out the house a bit more, travelling around Scotland doing things I want to do and seeing people I love to hang around with... All pretty much documented on my G+ profile. I use G+ like a blog and a vlog.

G+ has really encouraged me to be expressive, creative and a little bit wacky with the new people I've met through posts and hangouts. It's a place I feel I can be myself ^_^ Happy and accepted.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Diniz Chico - Lisbon, Portugal +Diniz Chico 

Well after a traumatic experience with Facebook, had decided to say ""no more Social Sites."" Completely unmotivated, spent almost 6 months without dedicating myself to my woods, that i always treated as an hobby and a way to relax my mind. But last December one of my sons, said to me: Why not Google +?? Immediately i reply nooo. He argued that it was a different system, but my Noo, prevailed. But i kept that in mind!! Huummm? Google +? Didn't never heard about it and decided to see. 

So i opened my account just for fun and had a circle about Photography, just to see what happened. I upload a few pics of my works and that's it. For 2 or 3 weeks after i even remember i had a new account. When i opened it one day, i noticed that some people had shown interest in what i was doing. Well I felt very cherished by the interest and the comments i received daily and since then i never stopped. And now i found myself like a ""Phoenix"" reborn from the ashes, always with new projects in my mind to make !! So a BIG thank you to all the Google Art Community..:)

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Nils Hitze (Kojote) - Bayern, Germany +Nils Hitze 

I was one of the first German users here and from Day one G+ feels like the home i had (in the Internet) back in my days as an Admin of Tutorials.de ... and it get's better every freakin day. I had this on Twitter, in the beginning. But not in this quantity.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Daniel Koeker - Riverside, California, USA +Daniel Koeker 

I joined Google+ when it was in beta, mostly because a) it was a Google product and b) because I was in beta and others weren't so neener neener. I wasn't sure what I expected when I came here, and goodness knows G+ has changed enough over the short time I've been here. It's quite unlike anything I've experienced from a social network before, and that sounds like an advertisement, but I've really, genuinely enjoyed myself here.

I've met a number of people who were complete strangers that I now talk to on a regular basis. I met people who are now voices of the G+ community. I've hungout with total strangers, talked about various topics, watched shows, got exposed to Doctor Who, and for some reason there are nearly five thousand people who have me in their circles. That is so weird to me.

What I've found here is a tight-knit community of intelligent people from all over the place. I've done more than I could have imagined here so far, and unlike other social networks that have felt like a chore, this is something I actually look forward to. As cool as G+ may be in design, it's the people that make it up, and some of the best people I know are all here; and the best part is that I wouldn't have known them at all if not for G+. I'd say that's pretty nifty.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Jamie Crouthamel - Charleston, South Carolina, USA +Jamie Crouthamel 

What Google+ has done for me is to present an amazing and fascinating group of people who have accepted me for exactly who I am. The ideas, thoughts, photos and work I post here have sparked incredible conversations and connected me to a network of people that encourage me and hold me accountable for being my most authentic self. 

Who knew people I have never met in person can help me to become the best version of myself? Google+ took the social network and elevated it to a network of intelligent, passionate individuals who have created the perfect environment for ideas and community to blossom.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Paul Stickland - Dorset, United Kingdom +Paul Stickland 

I joined G+ when my working life spirits were at a low ebb. I was drawing towards the end of a four year legal dispute that had seen all my best selling children's books out of print along with a subsequent cessation of royalties. I had been exploring the possibilities of selling my artwork via the world of Print on Demand during this time and guessed that G+ would be a great form of promotion for this.

In days I realised that it would be so much more!

I was talking to scientists, 3D printers, photographers, fellow illustrators, authors, artists, programmers, geeks and stars, WOW!

Artists, illustrators, authors can lead quite isolated lives and this huge rush of stimulation has been incredibly energising.

With the amazing benefit of the crowd-editing we enjoy here, you have all encouraged me to create so much new work this last year, work that I truly feel is closer to my true self than that coaxed out of me by 'professional' editors, whose decisions are, quite reasonably, driven by commercial imperatives.

However this intelligent and informed crowd-editing has resulted in a huge body of work, which in turn has led to a great deal of interest from the big publishing houses. What can I say?

Not just for this but for the friendship and humour shared with new friends around the planet, Thank You!  

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Brooke Johnson - Rogers, Arkansas, USA +Brooke Johnson 

Google+ first drew me with its Facebook-and-Twitter-but-better appeal. I was one of the first plussers, jumping in while it was still in beta, and it was interesting feeling my way around the new digital space, slowly finding interesting people to toss in my circles. After my first post last July, I’ve circled 900 people, and I’m flattered to say that over 1700 people have circled me—a number which seems to grow every day. Sometimes, I’m not sure why people circle me. I’m just a goofy girl who posts about writing and other things—Doctor Who, steampunk, science, publishing insights, various nerd-doms, music and movies I love, and random things I find interesting or pretty or funny. I guess people like that, or they wouldn’t keep circling me. :)
 
I have never had so much fun on a social network as I do on Google+, and when I go there, I can easily spend over an hour just talking to people. Actually talking. Conversations. That’s what I love about it. Everything I say means something. I’m talking to friends and having important discussions about science and fiction and what ifs, and of course, Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, who are very important topics. When I post something new, I feel like people are listening, and I feel like these people, separated by a few states or countries or sometimes oceans, that we’re all a big family, that we would do next to anything for each other. I consider a lot of people on Google+ as friends, and if I’m ever in close proximity to some of them, I will definitely let them know so we can meet up and have real life hijinks.
 
Now, I don’t interact will all 900 of the people in my circles or the 1700 people who have circled me, but there are a good 100 or more people that no matter what they post, I’m going to read it. I’m going to comment or +1 or share it, because they’re just that fascinating and fun.
 
As a writer, I’ve found Google+ to be a great place to talk about writing with other writers, whether they be novelists or screenwriters or poets, at all levels of experience. It’s a great place to mine information, test waters for an idea, share stories and updates about my writing experiences, talk about books, and debate about this publishing method or that one. It’s a community. And on the flipside, I feel like I’ve really connected with readers (who are sometimes writers too). I can talk about my book to people who actually care, who want to know how my next book is going so they know when they’ll get to read it. I have fans on Google+, people who will support my writing in any way that they can, and that’s fantastic. My experience as a writer on Google+ has shifted my focus from sales numbers and ratings and reviews to readers, to people who love books as much as I do, who love my books (or will, once I have more published). I feel like these people will stick with me and support me as long as I’m putting books out, and they make me feel like my writing and my books are worth it. They make me feel like I’m worth it.

I love that Sean has me in his Cool People that Matter circle (I hope that’s what it’s really called. It should be, if it isn’t already). I love that I stand out in a sea of other writers, artists, curators, and generally awesome people. I love that I matter to someone I’ve never met, that I’m interesting enough to be singled out, especially when we’re constantly bombarded from all sides with this picture and that video and ooh look! a funny gif and an interesting article, and so on. I feel like I’ve actually made connections with people I never would have met had I not tried this new social front, and I don’t think I ever would have really showcased myself—who I am, what I like—as I well as I have on Google+. And really, I’m more myself there than anywhere else.
 
Google+ is my digital home, where I can talk and discuss and rant and promote and share without constraints, without judgment, without hesitation, and I love it.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Laurie M +Laurie M  

When I first came to G+, in was still very new, but even so I was in complete awe and wonder over all that I found here. It was different from all the other places that I had been and tried and never really connected with, as well as different from the places that I had connected with. I'm very active other places, but my activities there are more targeted. Here the things I find speak to my heart, my mind, my soul and my spirit like nowhere else.

This place speaks the artistic side of me. I've found beautiful stories, music, videos and images from true artists in not just paint, but in photography, stories, poetry, music, mixed media, technology and so many other ways that I'd never dreamed of before it simply astounds me daily. 

I'm inspired by the true heart that I find in the people and their stories and experiences. The open their hearts and allow me in and in doing so they simply speak to my heart and my mind and move me in so many unexpected ways, I'm once again in awe and wonder.

I've enjoyed the interest, love and support of such beautiful and interesting people from all over my own nation and even further afield, throughout the world. I've even discovered some true friends in people that I would never otherwise have had an opportunity to have talked to let alone developed a relationship with. My life is all the richer for having these people and these experiences in it and even if I never were to speak to them again, they have changed me forever and hold a special place in my heart that is all their own. 

So in answer to your inquiry of what are my favorite things, the beauty of the people and all the wonders I see daily would have to be my favorite things and what has it meant to me, it's meant I've found people that speak to my heart and have enriched by life in their own unique and individual ways and I believe that they've changed me for the better.

Google Plus Hangouts are a magic carpet that can take you around the block or around the world in a matter of minutes.  Hangouts are a free broadcast tower in the middle of a powerful crowdsourcing tool where businesses have the ability not only to find customers but connect with them face to face.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Denise Morgan Kalicki - Manahawkin, New Jersey, USA +Denise Morgan Kalicki 

I can in on invite last July and knew no one!  But I could tell, right away, I had found my community!  Oh the things I saw and read, the wonders of the beautiful photography being shared, the wisdoms, and openness of sharing/trading/engaging ideas.  By the end of Oct. sparked by an idea raised in a post, I created the G+LeapYear Day Project- A day in the life of G+. 

The project asked that everyone on our +1 day of the year (Feb. 29th) submit a photo that showed some part of their life.  That was a wild, wooly and crazy day! 

I met wonderful people here, such as you Sean, the man who shared delightful movie shorts that made me laugh or haz a sad.  People play DJ, sharing playlists and videos.  We have hangouts that are magic! We have covert cupids, secret santas, and many heartwarming fund raisers. We have joined together to stop child abusers +Plussers Against Child Exploitation to help keep those idiots off G+ and continue to keep this a safe community.  

We all, now have good new friends, teachers and communities build over the net that joins us.  We can HiRL, hangout, watch stars being born, be interviewed for a news show in Missouri, get zombized, and best of all, all the food porn!  Oh the places we will go!  Even if we are bedridden because others can take us along via hangouts. I love G+ because of the wonderful people here.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Bearman Cartoons - Cincinnati, Ohio, USA +Bearman Cartoons 

When I first got an invite to join Google Plus, I ignored it. I was already on twitter (@bearmancartoons) and on Facebook both as a profile (https://www.facebook.com/bearmancartoons) and a page (https://
www.facebook.com/Beartoons). Why did I need yet another social media outlet. After the fifth email, I said what the heck and signed up.

Within the first few days I noticed something different that the other two lacked. Facebook is almost like a club where you have to know someone to get in. We have to know each other to “friend” one another and converse. For someone who draws cartoons for fun, that seemed great for my real life friends but horrible for creating new online ones.

With twitter, there was another issue. It gave me the ability to follow anyone and there was no obligation or expectation that they would follow me back. I could see what they had to say and even respond. Problem was, it is a pain trying to follow a conversation on twitter especially if you aren’t there in the beginning.

That is the difference I saw in Google Plus. I had the ability to follow whomever I wanted and we could engage in a conversation that was easy to follow as it was all in one place. The best of Facebook combined with the best of Twitter. In fact I posted this cartoon to show how I saw the difference between Google Plus and some other social media outlets. http://beartoons.com/2011/08/28/why-google-plus-is-better-than/


So I started circling people. About 200 based on my interests of cartoons, learning and Cincinnati. Some followed me back and some didn’t. Many I knew from other social media already. Where I think most people get frustrated with Google Plus is the expectation that everyone you circle will automatically circle you back. Not true. The next step is to actually ENGAGE with the people you circle. That gives them a better idea of who you are and gives them more of a reason to want to circle you back.

Three months in and this was the result: http://beartoons.com/2011/11/27/social-media-love/

And that was before circle shares.

I thought that all this would lead to more people visiting my site. Guess what? It didn’t. But it didn’t matter. I realized that I now had two equally engaging outlets for my work. In addition, I could post other thoughts and finds that don’t work well with my blog but are perfect for Google Plus.

One of those things was drawing caricatures. Sure I have done caricatures of politicians and celebrities in the past but avoided real people for some reason with a few giveaways on my blog. Inspired by Googlers like +byron rempel and +Cliff Roth, I started doing caricatures of other Google Plus members and started calling them “Muggings”. Anyone circling me could get on the list, but those who commissioned me would move to the front of the line. And because I am lucky enough to have a full time job, this was bonus money. 

So instead of having people pay me I could support one of my favorite charities, Crayons to Computers (http://www.crayons2computers.org/). This organization makes sure students and teachers in the Cincinnati area have the school supplies they need to be successful. So instead of paying me directly, I would have the person donate money directly to C2C in honor of Bearman Cartoons. So not only did they get their caricature but also get the tax write off!!! So I can play around on Google Plus, draw some pictures and raise money for charity. How cool is that?!!

So then I wanted to see the power of Google Plus. Using my own money, I promised to donate $1 to a DC comic led fight to combat hunger in Africa for every share of a video describing the program. https:/
/plus.google.com/103857459148999991693/posts/WUpMKa2eiQf

Several days later I announced the total of 387 shares of the video which spread the message to more people than I ever would on my blog. https://plus.google.com/103857459148999991693/posts/
gNaH8VSSuEc

Which led me to May 2012. For four years on my website, I have done a charity challenge where I will donate more and more money for my readers to take on certain challenges. Challenges included paying for every new twitter/facebook follower, guest cartoons, among other things. (http://beartoons.com/
2012/04/29/bearman-cartoons-charity-challenge-2012/) In the first three years, I put a limit on what I would spend and never hit it. This year with the help of Googlers, I hit the goal within 3 weeks. In addition, for the first time I promised to match donations to Crayons to Computers and several Googlers stepped up including, Ann Marie Dwyer , Liz Krane and Shani Hiraoka.

The support I have gotten from both my work and my fundraising efforts has been nothing short of amazing. What I think is sad, is that I have found myself at times checking into Google Plus before I even check my own blog. Well maybe not that sad.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Andrew Coffman (Firkked) - Oakley, California, USA +Andrew Coffman 

I heard about Google Plus just as the Beta was coming to a close and I pestered a Facebook friend for an invite (who is no longer active here).

Once here I found a great community that wasn't out to maximize friends for digital trinkets in online games or ranting about divisive issues with no hope of rational discourse, instead I found a community of diverse interests and a sincere desire to engage.

I had heard of engagement in social media, but never understood the context before my time on G+. I had control of both my message and who saw it, later I had control of how I saw others presenting their own messages.

Since I have been here I have been a part of helping others in real life through donations, wish lists, social activism, teaching, learning,  debates and live discussions in the hangout feature.

I have been able to share with others the audio-visual peeks into my little corner of the world and others have inspired me to share parts of my life I would have never shared in other outlets.

What Google+ Means to Me: The Story of Matthew Rappaport  - Bayside, New York City, New York, USA +matthew rappaport 

The Google+ Experience has and continues to be all about The People or YOU+ (as I like to post it). There are many social experiences online through many websites that have offered very cool  moments but G+ is the first one where people have gone all out in meeting others & interacting with complete strangers. It didn't take long to find people on the stream and through Hangouts to make the entire PLUSperience become more 4D than any that has come before.

There are no limits on how you can use PLUS and be creative, dive deep in head first showing the world not just your passions & life but YOU+ , your full personality. It's pretty amazing to show the world YOU+ through what you enjoy and easy to pick up on others by what they post, how they are in hangouts and eventually getting to +HIRL  (Hangout in Real Life) with them to make it a FULL, Complete CIRCLE!

I don't just say I have online friends or people I talk to online but I really do have brand new friends as well as people that I've now known over a year that are some of my best friends. There are so many on here with so much to share from art & music to comedy & culinary skills to humanitarian efforts and a whole lot that is nothing short of  #awesomesauce !

Each day I'm excited to see what my friends are posting as it leads to discovering new things, new people and what's going on in the world! Nowhere else has people involving people in such a selfless way to really engage and truly mean something more. 

As a new PLUS day came around, I found myself going for it and posting what I wanted to, when I wanted to. People laughed at me for using hashtags, mocked me for not understanding my humor or style and even thought I posted way too much but they were in a minority. It's actually refreshing to have diverse opinions and people not being afraid to express themselves here which is a big part of what makes it great. 

After the beta summer of Google+ and hanging out many hours to the point of seeing the sunrise more than I ever did before before sleeping, I decided to create a Hangout Chat/Interview show called Hangout Conversations w/Matt Rappaport to showcase people I've met on G+ and not just what they do but who they are and to show the world how awesome the entire Hangout / PLUSperience actually is.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+SteveGyrobotWood/posts/HSVgShgFfD8,"I have been having another mess around and here is an early Flexy-Hand 2 thermoformed palm mesh.

I created this primarily for the ""Thumbless"" Flexy-Hand 2 due to the difficulty of incorporating the recipient's  thumb into a velcro pocket and not loosing too much efficiency.

It is not ideal having to use screws to keep the mesh attached and agreed, they are a pain to screw in if like this example in the pictures you attach the mesh to Flexy-Hand with thumbs (it's all I had). But it will work using small sharp self tapping screws, and I like to keep the tabs folded down inside the palm area for aesthetics. However if you find it easier you could screw them to the outside of the hand, more functional if a little uglier.

There is a narrow and wide wrist option, and all the info is on Thingiverse : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:380665

Thanks to +Andreas Bastian for the thermoform inspiration.

I saw +Steve Wood  amazing work with insoles recently and I was delighted by his use of a simple flat bed scanner to scan feet. It occurred to me ""why the hell aren't we doing that for hands?"". It takes a dramatically more accurate photo, and the scaling is perfect and the printed image's scaling can be confirmed with a ruler.

The photo measurement method that we use today is riddled with issues that caus poor fits.

One of the problems with taking a picture of hands is that the pictures must be taken exactly perpendicular to the hands to minimize the measurement error. If a picture is taken at an angle, the hand that's further away looks smaller. Worse yet, the lens is round which introduces it's own variable distortions at different points of the photo. It all adds up, and the sum is a poor fit.

Things get even worse when we take a sophisticated measurement tool like tracker, and measure a distorted photo that's a bit blurry and taken at the wrong angle. We imagine that we're getting measurements right down to the mm because the software says so. The rule of all software applies however, garbage in, garbage out.

This might be a better way. Take a scan of the hand with a flatbed scanner! To validate that the image is captured and printed perfectly to scale, a ruler from http://printable-ruler.net/ is printed out and laid on the scanner when the scan of the hand is taken. This way, when the maker prints out the scan, he can lay his own ruler against the printed image to confirm that the mm or inch marks line up perfectly. The image should be scanned as a pdf, and should be printed with scaling = to 100%.

A second scan of the wrist with the palm perpendicular to the wrist is helpful, because the wrist tends to lift off the scanner bed when the palm is down against the scanner bed.

On top of that, you actually get a hand you can print out and put inside the 3d printed raptor before you send it. This will identify all kinds of fit issues.

If you're building a hand, and you think that the regular photos are just fine, I encourage you to have your recipient take a scan of his hand like the ones I posted above and then remeasure with the tracker software. I'm guessing you'll be surprised by how far off you were going to be... :)

I'd love to have some folks try this out and check it against the photos they would have used. Let me know you're results!

What works and what doesn't?

my expierience:

In Latvia there is only one enterprise which works with industrial 3d scanners. Sadly after trying to scan 7 y/o boy's hand it was not possible becouse kid's hand was shacking(moving, not much, but enought to make trouble for scanner), no matter of fixing and was not able to get 360 degree picture.

So i tried different way using Kinect(1st gen)(X-box camera for motion reading) together with Skanect(software, to make Kinect as scanner). teacher from my university has allready tried it with feet and results were pretty good. But appearantly after 2hr trying hand was too complex to be scanned.
Point to notice: there is Kinect 2 out in the market, but i haven't found software which cooperates for my needs.

Right now, luckly, after long discussions University has bought 3d Scanner, but as allways there is no one who can set it up or know how to use it, so it' s behind locked doors.(don't think anything will change in further 2 months)

so my only options, i see, is either:
1)to find out some awesome app for phone
(maybe this - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autodesk.Catch)
or
2)cooperating with some clinic and try to convert computertomograpie data to some data type which is 3d editable.

Have you tried last two, or maybe succesfully done previously written down two's?

I am in the process of fundraising for a 3d printer so that my students can help print prosthetic hands for e-Nable recipients. My school board will only allow me to have my students do this if our organization’s “risk management” thinks your “Safety Guidelines & Release and Waiver of Liability and Hold Harmless Agreement” are adequate to protect us from being sued. 
They would like to know if any e-Nable volunteer or employee has ever been sued from a recipient that has been injured because of the 3d printed prosthetic. They also want to know if there are any other private schools that are currently printing prosthetic hands for recipients. And what has their legal counsel said (if you know)?

I just found out that Washington state requires a license to create a prosthesis. $395 for initial application, then $195 a year after that. Are these printed hands considered a ""prosthesis""?
 
The waiver on the website (http://enablingthefuture.org/build-a-hand/safety-guidelines/) only provides protection for Enable, not the organization or individual making the device. 

So far our school's legal counsel is wondering if once we create the printed hand, do we send it to Enable, and then they send it to the recipient? Or does the school send it direct? Because if we send it direct to Enable and they give it to the recipient, that would be the preferred way to get involved. Maybe the only way from a release of liability standpoint.

Ok, I have printed alot of hands for LittleCoolHandLuke and as I sit putting these together, I inevitably think of changes that could be made. But my CAD skills are severely lacking. Anyone out there who wants a shot at helping out, here's your chance.

First up is simple. In the photo you will notice elastics and how I have attached them. First challenge is to design a way of replacing the screws with either pins or a bar with pins that allows you to tie the elastics to the pin then insert the bar into the existing holes. Said pins or bars can be glued if desired. Or we could drill holes in the palm right where the elastics come thru the phalanges as a tie off point. If that is structurally possible. 

Now on to the more difficult challenge. A year ago I printed a hand and mounted a ""guitar-tuner"" like tensioner on it. That tensioner worked great but I was told it was not structurally stable now. The current design works, but it is still hard for me, and I'm sure others, to tie the little strings and still get the tension right. So my next challenge is a tensioner redesign.  I was thinking of built in worm gears for each finger. That would eliminate the need for screws, too.

These are only suggestions for change. Please don't beat me up suggesting these. But please share your ideas and any changes you might like to see. Thanks! ",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

What I wound up with instead was a poseable finger. That got me thinking about poseable fingers and thumbs. One application that I think is interesting is in a case like this:

https://plus.google.com/116389039555125174531/posts/DSA2CzuTM2e

Maggie has 4 working fingers but no thumb. The quickest and surest solution to her problem is to create a static, non-moving thumb that she can use in opposition for either a pinch grip against the index finger, or in a power grip for larger items.

But what if the thumb, although not controllable by wrist actuation, was able to be posed into any position using the other hand, and then locked into place. It's an intriguing possibility.

During the recent R&D hangout, +Eric Griffin mentioned that he had once seen used loc-line used a finger. Loc-line is a posable hose that's used for a variety of applications including the camera tripod shown pictured above.

There is also a variant of loc-line that has a braided steel cable that runs through it. The cable is attached to a lever at the base, and when the loc-line has been positioned in the way you want, you turn the lever and lock it exactly where you want it. This has exciting possibilities for someone like Maggie. Here is a link to an example of the locking loc-line for a dial indicator stem that Eric Griffin posted:

http://www.starrett.com/metrology/product-detail/1-Precision-Measuring-Tools/11-Precision-Hand-Tools/1105-Indicators-and-Gages/110506-Holders/657TW

Although Maggie's hand is the immediate application for a loc-line solution. I think there could be others. I'm interested particularly in the joint. You can see from the pictures above that it's just a ball joint. This allows it to move in more than 1 direction.

I'd be curious to see what a full finger actuated on a raptor would look like. Or perhaps using it as just the end joint in a finger. Or maybe just in the knuckle joint. Or perhaps modifying the joint so that the sides are flat so it only moves in 1 plane, but retains the ball joint hinge, and locking capability. There are a lot of possibilities.

What interests me most about the ball-joint in the loc-line is that it's made of plastic. If it's plastic, it's 3d printable. It might be possible to print these and ""polish"" them with acetone. If so, it could be awfully fun to play with.

Anybody interested in trying?

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MelinaBrown73/posts/9Aw5Z2BdJwq,"Hi everyone!  Just a few things to cover with all of you:

-New volunteers
-Arm Team
-Hand kits for assembly events
-Current matching team load.

New Volunteers

I would like to welcome all of our new volunteers as part of our community and e-NABLE family. Please take a moment to complete our intake form if you haven't already. Once the intake form is completed,  you will receive a welcome email. We must express to everyone how important it is to thoroughly review the information it provides. We receive many emails asking questions that are covered by the welcome email and these emails pull us away from answering questions to which the answers are not readily available.  There are steps outlined to become involved but with that we need to ask everyone to research information and seek answers in the community as well. The last thing we want is for our newest volunteers to feel neglected but we currently don't have the manpower to reach out to each of you individually.  There is an immense amount of work going on behind the scenes to create and improve processes to better allow us to keep up but those take time. 

-Arm Team

We are in desperate need of a dedicated arm team to help pinpoint solutions that will allow for easier production while maintaining quality and function. If you are interested and have the time to devote to this effort, please email me at enablematcher@gmail.com with the subject line...Arm Team. We can then work to build a team and decide who can be the team lead in charge of organizing and moving the work ahead at a steady pace. +Skip Meetze +Jeff Erenstone

-Hand Kits

We have a ongoing demand for contributions of unassembled hand kits. These hands are assembled at events and then used to help those who need it most in the more remote areas of the world. This is a way to make a huge impact globally and take what we do to a new level.  We can deliver enough hands at one time to put smiles on hundreds of faces but we need help. Imagine the numbers we would have if every maker could contribute just one kit!

Hands consist of just the printed hand parts in a zip lock bag marked with the size.

-Matching Team load

All of us as a community realize that we have grown at a incredible rate.  This growth has put a strain on the matching teams ability to keep up with demand. We are currently adding several new members and also working on a new system and matching app that will provide more automation to the process BUT all of this takes time. Most do not realize that for now, what we do is completely manual, each step must be tended to by a member of the team. You can imagine how tedious this can be. We are doing the best we can with very few resources for the time being. All we can do is ask for patience and let each of you k ow how much you are appreciated and valued.  These are growing pains but it will get better. A year ago, we had to begin creating documents and processes from scratch. Now we are working to improve yet again. 

Thank you to each and every one of you for your hard work and dedication.  And also thank you for patience during this time of growth and development of infrastructure.

We have been looking at the Multi-Hand Sizing Guide, the width has a positive difference of 2mm but the length of hand has a positive difference of 5mm. How do we scale with those differences?

I've got a pie in the sky type thought that I'd normally just shut up about since its FAR removed from my area of expertise

However with the Johns Hopkins event and all the members that we have with a medical background, I figured I'd throw it out there and if theres something in it, and the right people are thinking about it, possibly it'd be something we could see in the future. Here goes (I might be totally off base so I apologize in advance if this is stupid)

Its my understanding that most of the conditions that we deal with here (where theres a residual palm due to ABS or other conditions) all the kids are missing fingers. The muscles and flexor tendons are there

What if you could carry out a surgery to ""extend"" these flexor tendons? cut open the palm for example, find each one of the tendons and attach a cable to the ends of each (with a sheath or tube around it). When you close the hand back up, you'll have 4 cables sticking out the top of the residual palm

Now if you attached a 3D printed palm and fingers to the users residual palm and used these extended tendons as the driving tendons for the fingers, you'd be able to drive each one of the 3D printed fingers just like a normal finger. Not depending anymore on flexion of the wrist. Granted the users might require some time to ""train"" the dormant muscles in order to get full functionality.....

Would be nice to have something like this on the horizon that brings functionality without reliance on wrist motion or batteries for myoelectric versions.....",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

""Hey, I messaged you and I guess you didn't have time yet with the conf and all, but it seems I made a mistake a costly one. I kind of got the impression the enable talon is the 50$ 3d printed prosthetic hand. I got the thing on thingy verse and asked a maker to print me one. Here in Israel the price quote (which was reasonable+) was ~120$ for one sided hand, when I wanted a part set with both hand options available, which ended up costing 200$+. It's way cheaper then other prosthetics, and maybe better as pros tend to be kind of old tech in my experience, but now I'm reading the instructions in order to understand what are the other parts I need to gather in order to assemble the hand in my local hacker space, and I stumbled upon some scaling quote, and what I gathered is that the file as available on thingyverse is for prosthetic for a young child? I mean my friend got small stature but I think I messed up :|
Is there a chance there is some experience maker with fund for such projects (for a person with limb difference) that can help me better in my area (Israel)? Is there someone I can speak to over the phone so I can have better grasp on the project at hand (no pun intended)?
Thanks,

I'm working with an 11 year recipient in Phoenix Arizona, who has four residual fingers 1cm-2cm in length and a thumb. The problem I have run into is that his hand is much longer (as measured from wrist to fingertips) than the 135% scaled palm that fits his wrist diameter.

I have attached the photo of his hand sitting on top of the cyborg beast fitting print-out. The printout was printed with the correct scaling so the printed 2cm marks match 2cm on a ruler, so that's not the issue. The bend of his wrist is correctly aligned with the reference mark on the print-out, so that's not it either. He just has a big healthy hand! You can see that his hand overlaps the end of the palm printout by about 20mm.

I need to figure out how to lengthen the palm cavity so that his hand will fit, but I don't have any 3d design experience whatsoever. It's just way out of my league. Is there anyone who help, or that can point me in the right direction?

I was randomly at a yard sale today when I saw a pair of crutches, and they gave me the idea for a universal sizing system on forearm/full arm devices.

Just a thought, but where we use pvc tubing, that could be replaced with something like this. Once cut down, it could be a set system for any sized recipient, a young child, or expanded for an adult.

As a child grew, he could take it out a notch, or like our little friend, young Derek, who wanted an arm LONGER than his other, he could have the option to shorten it back down when it was more convenient

I picked them up for a whopping $1.50 total, and pulled the expandable rail out of one. They are already super light weight, and very strong. Built for supporting body weight already.

Just a fun Idea, but something to think about.

Here are a few things we learned:
* a rotating wrist is cool and apparently innovative  (pronation and supernation) 
* elbow actuation can require minimal bending of the arm (we have a new mechanism to increase the leverage)
* aligning the elbow hinge with the elbow joint is important (we're working on an adustable hinge mechanism)
* an across-the-back harness to keep the arm in place is probaby a good idea
* casting with alginate and plaster of paris is easy, fun, and satisfying
* padding and silicone sleeves need further research
* the gauntlets and socket cups need to use as much length as possible...but mustn't impinge on armpits or elbow pits.
* it's important to make sure you put a Left Hand on a Left Arm!

Perhaps even individual families or church or civic groups that they belong to might sponsor hands for our children to assemble.

2) What age ranges would be able to assemble the hands?  We will definitely want the children to participate as much as possible for their age group.  Our kids range in age from 3-12 years old.

I am a 59-year old, widowed woman, who has been physically challenged since birth. I was born missing my left arm below the elbow. At the time, in the mid- to late 50's, I was the youngest child to be given a prosthetic. I had all kinds of great therapy at NY Hospital, starting at about age 3. When I turned about 13, I realized that I could function better without the prosthetic; they were not at all functional back then. So, for the past 46 years, I have been doing everything without one. However, since my husband passed away in 2008, I find that there are a few things that could be done easier, if I had a prosthetic. My dilemma now is that I have become disabled due to a chronic illness. My income is limited to my SS disability. That does not give me extra funds to get a regular prosthetic. I also am realistic enough to realize that a full length prosthetic would require a fair amount of rehabilitation therapy, since it would add more than 12 inches to my reach. When I heard about your project, using 3D printing from Solidoodle, I thought this might be a great option for me. All I need is a prosthetic hand to wear on the small part of my left arm below the elbow. I just need to be able to hold nails or screws, while I do repair and projects on my small farm. I would greatly appreciate your consideration of my request. I realize that your project deals with children, but perhaps extending this to adults could help people like me or even returning veterans, who are amputees. I hope you will contact me to discuss the additional applications for your product. I would be very happy to be the person, who makes this new option available to the many people in need.

I believe that by utilizing the artificial muscle platform on top of an internal bone structured artificial limb we could achieve a more human like artificial limb with twice the strength and ability.

Maybe taking each strand and coating it individually with something like flex seal (a rubber coating of sorts) and even making larger scale strands to form artificial ligaments/tendons

Thoughts?

Here's a bit of late night psuedo-science for anyone interested in Oogoo foam.

One of the things that I was curious about was whether or not I actually managed to balance the Ph of the oogoo foam I created by adding baking soda and vinegar to my regular oogoo mix. Doing this created a cool foam that could conceivably be used in lieu of foam padding or in sockets or some other fun application.

The concern with all oogoo from a skin safety standpoint is that although the silicone is food-safe, it creates acetic acid (vinegar) during the curing reaction, which could be a skin irritant. I wanted to see if my oogoo foam was still slightly acidic. So like any normal person, I decided to set up a modest lab to test it. Mind you, I think I got a C in chemistry 15 years ago or so, and that's my sole qualification for this experiment.

To start, I got the most sensitive Ph testing kit available off the shelf in my small town. I bought it for $5.00 at Petco pet store. It's intended use is for testing the Ph of water in aquarium tanks. The nice thing about it is that it tests between 6.0 and 7.8, which is a pretty tight range around neutral ph of 7.

Next I went looking for distilled water, without luck, so I settled for Poland Spring water. The poland spring water tested at a Ph of 6.6, which based on an internet search is quite plausible. My Tap water tested at around 6.8, but god knows what else is in it, so I stuck with the Poland Spring water.

Next, I tested how sensitive the test was to a base, by using less than a gram of baking soda mixed into the 5ml of Poland Spring water in the test tube. Just a gram was enough to raise the Ph from 6.6 to 7.8 pretty decisively. I deemed this sensitive enough for my purposes.

Next, I took a block of oogoo about 0.75""x2.5"" and put it on my cutting board. Then I minced it up like garlic, and hoped to god my wife wouldn't come into the kitchen catching me in the act. Fortunately, the book she was reading was quite good, and she didn't see any of this. :)

When it was nicely minced, I poured 10ml of water into a clean glass cup, and added the minced oogoo foam, and then stirred it rigorously with a chopstick for about 5 minutes to leach out any acetic acid from the oogoo into the water.

Next I poured the slurry into a coffee filter, and dripped the water back into my test tube. I then performed the Ph test per the package instructions and was very surprised by the results.

Not only is the Oogoo foam not acidic, it's actually slightly basic. It raised the Ph of the Poland Spring water from 6.6 to 7.8. That's about the same Ph as many other spring waters right out of the bottle (google it).

I wouldn't suggest that based on this test alone that oogoo foam is skin safe. But one thing is for sure, it sure as heck isn't acidic :)

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+PeterBinkley5/posts/eAd39QWNf7p,"EXPERIMENTAL Design Feature: Spreading Fingers

I've thought for a while that having four fingers all running the same direction seemed a bit redundant. And while I put a slight deviation on the finger joints of the Raptor, it isn't particularly noticeable. I was wondering what would happen with a curved knuckle pin. Would that give the user greater opposition between the thumb and fingers, improving adaptability to large objects like a ball or a cup? Or would the fingertips just collide with each other, resulting in a hand that doesn't fully close? Or maybe a bit of both?

This prototype is basically an Osprey with one experimental design feature: a curved knuckle block.  Pretty successful for a first run. I started with a photo of my hand fully spread and did a little angular analysis. I decided on 15 degrees of spread between adjacent fingers, for a total index-pinky spread of 45 degrees. I went intentionally extreme with the first iteration, just to see the idea in action. 

The geometry looks more organic, and it may improve thumb-to-finger opposition, although I haven't done any grip testing. Strung up with all the fingers cabled equally, the fingers collided with each other at full flexion. So I played with different grip patterns (adjusting the length of each cable individually), and had some success with Peregrine's preferred configuration, the pinky-leading fan. You can see it in the video footage, which will need to be in another post, since I can't add both photos and video to this post. It looks pretty cool, at least. 

Next, I'm probably going to try 10 degrees of interdigital spread for an index-to-pinky total of 30 degrees. If I find a really successful configuration, I'll get behind the feature, but for now it's purely experimental.

The video describes a well-defined problem:  a good grasp conforms to the shape of the object.  Our grasps do not: the first finger to be stopped by an object stops all the other fingers.

The diagram describes a poorly-defined solution.  If all the fingers shared the same ""pool"" of line and pulleys allowed non-blocked fingers to take up the remaining slack...  Then we might get a smart grasp....

I rushed the print to make a meeting this weekend so it is not a high quality print, but it is enough to get the gist of it.  Incorrect hardware aside, it came together pretty well.

In order to get good smooth motion, I added some 0.010"" brass shims in the joints to keep the plastic from rubbing.  Really cleaned up the motion quite a bit.

Any pointers on getting the elastic dialed in? I tied them to a short piece of filament and created a channel in the hand so the filament sits flush.  To adjust I just added wraps around the filament and tied a knot. My first attempt was to tie them in pairs, but this didn't allow for individual adjustment of each finger and was very difficult to adjust.  I am only moderately happy with where I ended up.  Maybe I have the wrong elastic, but trying to get enough tension to pull the finger up to horizontal AND not require too much force to close was not achievable.  They sag a bit when the hand is held horizontal.  Is this normal?

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AndreasBastian/posts/NogMjZHYNxG,"Announcing Raptor 2.0 Beta, Fusion 360 Edition!  This is a parametric solid body iteration on the Raptor hand that can easily be downloaded as IPT, STEP, IGES, STL, or OBJ files.  Additionally, the entire design has been documented in detailed 2D drawings specifying all important interfacing dimensions.  This iteration of the Raptor is designed to lower the barrier to collaboration and contribution-- with models in a parametric and easily adaptable format, it will be much easier to try new ideas.  The 2D drawings serve as a ""hardware API"" that describe how to design geometry to interface with the Raptor 2.0 fit scheme, which is itself derived from the Cyborg Beast fit scheme.  

The Raptor design team has been steadily testing for the past several weeks, but now we're ready to beta test in the community!  We would love to get more feedback on this design, so please print, assemble, and test!  After the incorporation of community feedback, we can launch Raptor 2.0!

Changes/Improvements:
-Cyborg Beast-compatible fitting (wrist width and maximum palm width)
-Narrower knuckle-block and wrist for better fit
-More accessible cable routing
-Easier elastics tie-off
-Removable knuckle pins for easy maintenance/repairs
-Improved retainer clip for dovetail tensioner
-Custom-modeled supports for both palm and gauntlet for better interior surface finish and velcro-slots
-Additional lateral velcro mounting options for the palm
-More ""head room"" in the palm (less of an aggressive taper to the knuckles)
-Tensioner pins have thicker walls and bigger holes for threading the flexsors

Know issues:
-The cabling between the palm and the gauntlet is offset by a few millimeters
-The wrist spacing on the palm is 51mm instead of the intended 50mm.  This gives a little extra clearance between the gauntlet and the palm and is not detrimental to function, but will be taken to 50mm for consistency's sake.

Files can be found here for now, but will be moving to a more permanent location later this week: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/clnglxhexhlk5mu/AAAFLJE297GKWmuaIgXQ1vsva?dl=0

A final note:  if you are planning on modifying the files in Fusion, please hold on for a little while longer.  I am doing one more from-scratch restructuring of the palm and gauntlet to make them more robust to parameter changes near the beginning of their structural trees.  STEP/IGES mods should be fine in the meantime.

Many of the pictures show it in a not quite complete state - the pictures don't show some final medical foam and velcro for example - but it is mostly all there.  There are a couple of videos in the gallery on Thingiverse where you can see a couple of the features.

The hands biggest feature is two degrees of freedom based loosely on a design idea from +Bob Roth .  The wrist has a gimbal to allow ulnar-radial flexion in addition to the standard motion.  It does not much change the way the fingers close like Bob was trying, but it does provide a great deal better freedom of motion for the user.

This also has the sprung tuners I wrote about earlier.  You can see them in action on the thing page.

There are a lot of other improvements from the first version that will not be so obvious.  For example, I made the neutral position slightly flexed upward and adjustable based on input from some in the medical profession.  I also lifted the strings away from the wrist pivot point so that the fingers could close with less of a severe hand angle, and so that the strings would not rub against the user's wrist.

As always, it is fully parametric OpenSCAD.  I made the code a lot better in this version.  I separated out most of the key parameters to a separate file to make it easier to build a consistent set of parts.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LindenBromwich/posts/UyNXb56b7G2,"Hi All,

I've had a bit of a search through old posts and the e-NABLE website but haven't managed to satisfactorily answer this myself, so some more experienced input would be good (Excuse the long post but in this circumstance, it pays to be thorough). 

I'm curious and a tiny bit concerned around the legal aspects of the e-NABLE project. As a current student of Biomedical Engineering, I have been learning a lot about the legal frameworks for Medical Device Regulation in several markets (mostly US, EU & AU). From the FDA website, it is quite evident that external upper limb prosthetics are classified as a Class I medical device in the US, covered under CFR 890.3420 (Source: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=890.3420 & https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpcd/classification.cfm?ID=5060). In Australia, the TGA classifies the device as a Class I medical device as well and has some good guidelines on ""Custom Made Medical Devices"" (Source: https://www.tga.gov.au/custom-made-medical-devices). I haven't had a chance to look into the EU (I should be studying for exams right now) but I'm assuming it would be along similar lines too.

Focusing on the US, In CFR 890.3420 the FDA states that this type of medical device is ""exempt from adherence to the 'Good Manufacturing Practice' requirements with the exception of 820.180, regarding general requirements concerning records and 820.198, regarding complaint files, as long as the device is not labelled or otherwise represented as sterile."" This is good news, as compliance with the long and stringent list of GMP requirements would be near impossible for a diverse group of volunteers and manufacturing facilities. However, this doesn't mean e-NABLE is clear of the regulatory woods so to speak.

I know the argument has been made that these devices are not being commercially sold and therefore do not fall under medical device regulations, but I don't think this argument holds any water, a medical device is a medical device, regardless of whether it sells for a million dollars or is given away free (would be happily proved wrong if anyone has a reliable source though).

My main questions to the group would be:
1. Has anyone in the e-NABLE community looked deeply into the regulatory requirements surrounding the use of these kinda devices and started formulating a basic regulatory strategy/plan? If not I think this could be a useful addition to the ""Safety Guidelines"" section on the website.  
2. Jon Schull uploaded a draft from the FDA regarding 3D printed medical devices. Has there been any follow-up or developments on this?
3. Has anyone opened a dialogue with any regulatory affairs agencies such as the FDA around the use of devices such as this?

Some key features I think that could definitely benefit the e-NABLE project should regulatory affair (and god forbid the FDA) get involved:
a. Device production records keeping. Minimum records would include basic patient details (would need to look further into privacy issues), key production information (materials and methods used, any part failures or revisions, any disinfection undertaken [Note avoid the use of the word sterilisation]). This could possibly take the form of a standard document that is filled out by the volunteer manufacturer's post-production and uploaded to a database for each device produced.
b. Unique device identifiers to enable faulty product tracking. This could take the form of a unique code for each device produced generated by a central database (linked with the above production records, the patient and the individual that produced the device)
c. A Corrective and Preventative Action (CAPA) Plan. This is a fundamental aspect of any Quality Management System. A CAPA is one of the first places the FDA like to look, and the absence of a CAPA system is a huge red flag. A key component of this would be feedback and complaints handling from patients who have received the device. Jen Mankoff sent a notification the other day about starting up a feedback Pool which would address this
d. A very clear ""intentions of use"" statement that is available on the website, and is provided to the patient with each device. All medical devices normally have to have one of these, in short, it states the conditions that the device can be used to treat, and how the device is to be installed and used normally. This may seem obvious but is incredibly important so that a patient doesn't try to stick the device in their eye and then sue you for causing their blindness. I'm happy to say that the basics for this are well covered on the  ""Safety Guidelines"" section on the website already.
e. Theres lot's more but the above will do for talking points for now...

I'm not suggesting that we should be looking to submit a regulatory application to any of the major regulatory bodies, this would become time-consuming and expensive very quickly, but it may not hurt to have some of these details well documented. In fact, I think it could hurt a lot to completely disregard some of these issues and I'd hate to see the e-NABLE community face sanctions or get shut down as a result.

Again sorry for the long winded post, if you've gotten to here then thank you for sticking with me. I just thought I'd draw attention to regulatory issues for those in the community that may be unaware, and would also like to hear the thoughts of others on how we can address this challenge, especially any that have experience in the medical devices industry.

I've got a lot of good and current documentation on regulatory requirements from my University Course that I'd be willing to share with anyone who's interested, and I'd be willing to help out the community to help develop and implement some of the items mentioned above. I know regulatory affairs is a subject most people would consider as palatable as drinking acid but its also sadly a necessary evil and ignorance of the issues isn't a valid defence.

I promised myself that I wouldn't take on any more projects/experiments until the Prosthetic Utility Framework Project was complete. But this idea came to me at 2:00am and was interesting enough to wake me up. Since I had to disassemble the bowden tube hand anyway to fulfill an existing commitment, I was happy to rationalize it as stretching that promise rather than breaking it.

The idea that I had was to try to get around Hooke's Law by attaching the return elastic to the tensioning cable itself. By introducing a pulley at the top of the palm, the idea was to make it so that the elastic is always in tension (pulling the fingers open) but actually under the same tension through the full articulation of the finger.

In my head, it seemed like a sneaky way to get past Hooke's law, which holds that the further you stretch an elastic the more force it requires. The downside of Hooke's law is that in the standard configuration, the more you close the fingers, the harder it gets. This robs the user of a surprising amount of potential gripping force.

What I wound up with was fingers that seem to be in a state of mechanical equilibrium such that they are pose-able in any position the user wants. The upside is that there is nearly 0 tension from the elastic through the full range of motion when the fingers are closing. I say nearly 0 because in actuality, the tension from the elastic that is experienced is actually slightly assisting to close the grip rather than open it!

There is an obvious downside to this. The fingers don't return to the open position on their own. In order to open them, it's necessary to brush them against you're thigh or some other object. But once you've opened them, they stay open. Or half open. Or in any other position you put them in.

I don't know if the upside outweighs the downside, but I thought it was an interesting idea that folks might want to play with. There are a lot of ways to play with this idea. Maybe the fingers are in mechanical equilibrium, but the thumb has a normal elastic. May a snap pin with a collar printed around it to make a pulley in lieu of a screw. Or maybe something way cooler altogether...

When printed in PLA, the thermoforming is easy because hot water in a tray gets the part up to glass transition temperature.  It can even be formed around the recipients arm with a towel between the skin and the hot part.

When printed in ABS it is trickier because an oven must be used and the part remains in the rubbery state for only a few seconds when exposed to room temperature.  Try setting it on a block of wood on a tray and watch for the wings to droop.  Then take the tray from the oven and form the curves with gloved hands.

The criss-crossed layers maintain their plywood properties after being thermoformed so that the part is very strong like molded plywood boat hulls. 

This first iteration of a printed flat, then thermoformed Raptor Reloaded Gauntlet has not been tested yet, but I wanted to get the concept out so others can be playing with the design too.

The design was created in Tinkercad from the Raptor Reloaded stl file and it can be modified at https://tinkercad.com/things/bgGS12sgROb

I am new to this community.  I have been working a few weeks at making a hand for my sister, Chris.  Towards that end, I posted Thingiverse things 203208, 203954, 204621.  Francisco contacted me and made me aware of this community.

I wanted to ask the community opinions on the optimal drive string for these hands.  For my initial test builds, I have been using 100 lb test braided fishing line (Spectra PowerPro).  I chose that because of some experience with it in the 3D printing world.  The stuff is insanely tough and, unlike normal fishing line, hardly stretches at all.  It occurs to me, however, that those properties might not be the ideal.  For instance, maybe a little bit of stretch in the drive strings is a good thing.  Anyone tried using something similar?  If so, did it work well, or is there maybe something better?

I appreciate any input, and hope that I will be able to contribute some value to the community as my build continues.

... or something like that...

This is a one-night foray into the leg prosthetic concept for my own personal use.  I have severe arthritis in my knees and at this weight it sure is tough to be vertical, much less walk.  That has to change, and fast.  

The weight is coming off slowly and steadily, but those knees are not getting any better with the passage of time.  So rather than get knee surgery which really isn't an option yet, I thought I'd toy around with designing my own leg support.  

The purpose of this device is to take some, not all, just some of the burden off of the knees.  To wear it I'd step on the green platform and tighten up the red belts which surround the four PVC pipes.  

Topping off the pipes is a little 3D printed finesse of my creation and I have no idea if it will work.  It's the 3D printed  grey (carbon fiber) and blue (semiflex) filaments  The blue softies are free to rotate and perform a cam/lever type of operation against the skin, gripping and taking some of the load by rotating and pressing all cam-like into the leg when load is applied, releasing when load is removed.

  Great, you printed a hand, but is it up to snuff?  Did you know tensioning a hand is more of an art than a science?  Seeing an operational hand in person is like the difference between reading about a hand's operation and seeing a video of it in operation.  Being able to talk to a person who has produced a finished product is the Holy Grail of hand production.

   I just want to share an experience, and encourage other new members to respectfully do the same if they can.  Recently I contacted the leader of my closest e-Nable group, Eric Bubar at Marymount college in Va, to see if I could meet with him.   I am very new to 3D printing, with only 3 months of experience, so I wanted someone with experience to look at my prints especially the hands to make sure I was on the right track.  Eric was very nice, and luckily his current schedule allowed him to give me a tour of his lab.  I was very lucky with my timing; Eric was in a good position to to devote a couple of hours to answering questions and giving me some insights.  He also invited me back whenever his time allows, because I think he sees that I appreciate the value of his time and will try not to waste it.
(NOTE: Be patient with your local contacts; they may have very busy schedules that make their replies slow. Putting ""New Local e-Nable Volunteer"" in your subject will help make your contact stand out above the spam of daily life.)
  I learned a lot of new things, and I'd like to share them with the community in a series of upcoming posts. I'm trying to keep the posts relatively short to avoid a ""wall of text"".  In this post  I'd like to share the most important thing I learned:

WE ARE TOY MAKERS

   I in no way wish to insult our community or their hard work, but this lesson is based on Eric's approach to dealing with clients. He said he does his best to lower expectations so no one is disappointed, or injured trying to do something the device can't do.
  He said, "" If you can't do it with one hand don't do it with an e-Nable device because it could fail"".  He also told me he had met a Dr. at a conference once who told him the devices we make are toys, to which Eric in effect replied ""As long as we make the ""toys'"" limitations clear, how can that be a bad thing?""  We aren't selling ""snake oil"",  we are giving it away for free with a money back guarantee.
   Our homemade ""toys"" may not be as functional as professionally manufactured equipment, but they do serve one very important function; they grant the wearer new self confidence, especially if the device is tailored to the client's preferences in color and theme.  That alone can help change someone's life for the better. (Being able to toss a ball or hold a book doesn't hurt either.)
  Thanks Eric; this one thing has made me feel a little less trepidation about helping people in the future. Making a prosthetic was actually quite intimidating, but making a functional ""toy"" that might only make someone feel a little better about their life is right up my ally.  This in no way makes me feel I can produce a shoddy ""toy"".  Far from it:  I want to make the safest toys I can, because production cost and time aren't an issue.
   I'm proud to aspire to join the ranks of other ""toy"" makers out there trying to make someone's life a little more fun, and if a little more function is a side effect so be it.
  As long as it is tempered with proper limitations to keep safety in mind I don't see any down side.

Black elastics aren't a great solution for finger opening. For smaller children, or children with weak wrists, I suspect they consume 25%-50% of the potential grip strength when the fingers are all the way closed. This is because of Hooke's law, which says that the longer you stretch a spring (or elastic) the more force it takes.

The exception to Hooke's law is the constant force spring. These ingenious little devices maintain a constant force no matter how long you stretch them.

I've been thinking it would be great to mount one of them inside the palm to serve a single return elastic for the fingers (1 spring for 4 fingers). You would route dyneema fishing line through the fingers and tie all 4 off to the constant force spring cable. This way, you'd have the same amount of resistance no matter how much you closed the fingers.

I just found a great little spring that costs about 50 cents each, and comes premade in it's own housing. I just bought a 5 pack at Staples (they were charging $2.00 each though). It's just a retractable ID badge! It's a great little constant force spring though. I think it has enough pull to do all 4 fingers. The spring housing is quite small ~1"" diameter and 1/4"" thick, but it can handle 36"" of travel, which is overkill since we only need 2"", but it has the same pull whether you do 1"", 2"", or 36"".

It would be mounted directly underneath the cable block at the back of the hand. Right now this is just dead space. There's plenty of room to superglue the housing here. It also wouldn't be visible, because it would be inside the palm cavity (a hole would be drilled for the string to come out).

It's a pretty cheap, easy way to get past Hooke's law. No matter how far you close the fingers, the elastic has exactly the same resistance.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/110736851786370579318/posts/XGf8rY8zLjz,"Mechanical Bonding With Oogoo: 3d modeling help needed...

The biggest problem with Oogoo is that it doesn't stick to PLA or ABS. It needs to be mechanically affixed. My first solution was to create a lamination using alternating layers of cotton cloth and oogoo. This can be screwed, or riveted.

A better solution for affixing oogoo to a palm or fingertip is to create a surface that will mechanically bond to oogoo. My first thought was an inverted cone or a dovetail within a finger or palm that the oogoo could be molded right into. That way it would be replaceable. Then I started thinking that oogoo is so durable tear resistant, it's likely the hand would be destroyed long before the oogoo was ever scratched. If that was the case, it might make sense to have it permanently affixed.

This lead me to think that a good way to do it would be to create a surface that creates a mechanical bond with the oogoo. My first thought was create a 3d printed mesh on the surface that you want to apply oogoo to. You'd just print the part with the mesh surface, and spread the oogoo on it. When it cured after about 30 minutes, it would be permanently affixed. To get it off, you'd need to use a right angle grinder or a belt sander, or a blast furnace (the latter would be tough on PLA or ABS)

The screenshot you see is of a simple matrix of 2 rows of 3d printed pipes. Each row is 90 degrees to the other. The pipes are about 1mm in diameter, and the spaces are about 1mm in diameter. The whole patch is about 40mm in diameter. Ideally the mesh would be sitting on a 2mm flat plate to replicate the surface of a 3d printed palm. The flat plate should overhang the mesh by 1cm or so, so that there's something to grip with the fingers/pliers while trying to pry the oogoo off.

What I'd like to do is get an STL file that I can print of this matrix or something like it. I'd like to print it, spread some oogoo on it, and test the heck out of it. The dimensions don't really matter to much, I'd just like to see if this idea will work.

I don't know how to do 3d modeling in a way that will give me an stl. Is there anyone who could do a quick mock-up and post it to thingiverse?

Has anyone tried anti-reflective coating/film over 3D scanner?

Recently while trying to achieve better positioning while scanning foot for Ankle-foot-orthosis I had troubles with my Sense scanner, because light reflected against the glass through which I scanned. Scanning through glass gives loads of improvements for seeing actual pressure areas and helps to reduce manual after-modeling. But once lighting is not perfect - measuring results with 2 mirrored scans, because reflected light projects as separate scan for scanner. 

I'm guessing if I can reduce artifacts and reflected images using Anti-reflective film over 3D scanners sensor.

Originally shared by Laird Popkin
Weekly hangout, in the mornings in the US and afternoons in Europe every other week.

Agenda:

1) Review the development site (http://webapp.e-nable.me/dev/) for release to production. Is it ready? What must be done before we release?

Improvements include:
- Simplified measurements and scaling (simpler = more consistent results)
- Larger pins at larger sizes (less looseness)
- Label ""etched"" into sides and end of palm.
- Supports for fingers
- Google Analytics tracking
- Much improved logging (in the zip file)
- Preview colored parts, so easier to see what's what

There's one current bug, which is that in the assembled preview the fingers aren't rendered. The individual files render fine, and the STLs are fine.

2) Exciting, initial discussion with Fusion's product manager and OpenSCAD's lead and HOM (Andreas and I) about how we could potentially generate OpenSCAD from Fusion. The initial target will be e-NABLE, but the applications are more broad over time.

3) Discuss and prioritize next round features, such as:
- Integrate Augenmass
- Short tracking URLs
- Parametric finger selection
- Help users select between different designs (Talon, Ody, Raptor, arms, etc.).
- Add different designs into HOM (Talon, Ody, Cyborg Beast, Flexy Hand).

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+PeterBinkley5/posts/6ANhNWjXcNG,"I'd like to give a shout out to the good people at Ultimaker. https://ultimaker.com/

Over the last year, they have donated several Ultimaker 2 printers and a bunch of money to e-Nable, and asked for nothing in return. And they have been kind and supportive every step of the way.

When I met +Erik de Bruijn  (Co-founder) and +Sander van Geelen  (Community Manager) at the Hopkins e-Nable conference, I was first struck by their friendliness, and then their brilliance. Erik and I discussed some interesting solutions for e-Nable devices, and by the next day, he had already scripted a printable ratcheting mechanism in OpenSCAD and was ready to share it with me.

I can honestly say that their machines are mechanically awesome. Ultimaker machines complete print jobs very quickly and with excellent results. The Bowden-style filament feeder makes a very lightweight print head possible, so high speeds don't rattle the box. They are also very easy and intuitive to use. I don't think I've read a single instruction for my Ultimaker 2, and I get consistently beautiful prints. But don't take my word for it, read some reviews, and note how they are ranked #1 in pretty much every recent consumer-level 3D printer shootout.

One morning a couple months ago I noticed my machine had a little broken piece, so (even though the machine printed just fine) I contacted the company. They alerted their US hub, who called me within 15 minutes and had a replacement part in the mail the same morning, free of charge, shipped for free. It arrived in my mailbox two days later. I've never encountered customer service that was so responsive and so generous.

You should also know that Ultimaker has chosen to pursue a completely open platform. Both the software and the hardware are open-source, so when you get an Ultimaker, you truly own it. I'd say that they are totally philosophically compatible with e-Nable, or as close as you can get and still be a for-profit company.

And did I mention that they are really nice people too? 

So if you're thinking about getting a 3D printer, you can feel good about getting an Ultimaker. If you have the money, the Ultimaker 2 is the best of the best. If you want to spend less and assemble a kit, the Ultimaker Original is also a very fast and accurate machine. I'd suggest getting the plus model with the heated glass bed.

This normally closed hand was built using 10# elastic tubing intended for fitness/strength training. It's really strong stuff. The elastic tubing is actually routed through the palm, not over the gauntlet.  It gives a wonderfully strong grip. Maybe too strong. Opening the hand takes way too much power in the existing configuration. I call it the Hulk hand both because it's green, and because the biggest challenge is figuring out how to control the power :) It's not worth much right now, but it's a good starting point.

It's not even close to a finished product it still needs a lot of work. Getting a good grip is one thing, opening it easily is is entirely another. It may need that marvelous ratchet assembly +Erik de Bruijn has been working on. The point of this project was to see how much grip could be achieved with a Raptor hand, and what additional functionality a better grip could offer. It's really just a starting point, and an interesting case study in what these Raptor hands are capable of. These hands are sturdy! Now I just have to figure out the opening part :)

The hand only has 4 fingers because my recipient has a thumb, and this hand is just a leftover that wasn't sized correctly. My goal is to have a hand ready for him to canoe when summer camp starts up next year. I think it's an achievable goal.

Molded Palm: A new feature in this hand is the molded palm, which is made of Oogoo. The recipe for Oogoo is just cornstarch and a $3.00 tube of silcone. Here is the link to the instructable where I got the recipe:

http://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Make-Your-Own-Sugru-Substitute/

There are large bumps on the palm that mate with the fingers when closed. The palm looks ugly, but it works like a champ. Ultimately, I'd like to create 3d printable molds that scale with the hand. You'd print your hand, print the mold, whip up a $1.00 batch of Oogoo in 5 minutes, fill the mold, and have a custom fit palm and fingertips ready to go after a 10 minutes of work and a 1hr cure time. Alternatively, it could be printed in Filaflex for those who have upgraded their printer with the right extruder; this is another reason why I need to put an upgraded extruder on my shortlist.

Molded Fingertips: This hand has some incredibly ugly Oogoo fingertips. I whipped up a batch as an afterthought and just slathered some on. It's wonderfully elastic, durable stuff, and at 4mm thick, it molds around shapes just like our fingers do. This dramatically improves the grip performance. They can be much prettier if made in a 3d printed mold.

Adaptive Grip: This hand has a nifty adaptive grip. Take a look at the grip that it has around the pepper shaker. I knew it work work in theory, but actually seeing it do it was wonderful.

Pen Holding!: This thing can hold a pen and take notes thanks to the molded palm. Check out the video.

Paper Holding: It can pick up a sheet of paper as easily as it can pick up a ream of paper. This is due to the molded palm.

Fork Holding: Same trick as the pen. A molded palm makes a world of difference. Take a look at the pic of it skewering a banana and picking it up with ease. This think has a wonderful grip for thin objects like pens, forks, knives, etc. Take a look at it holding a very heavy 8"" chef's knife with a full forged blade (it's 3/16"" thick on the back of the blade).  You could chop and dice an onion with this hand!

Egg Holding: This thing has a wicked grip, but not as much as you might think. It doesn't take that strong of a grip to hold heavy objects; the key is the molded palm and fingers. It can pick up an egg or a banana without crushing them. In truth, I was a bit worried about the egg :)

I've basically been walking around my kitchen picking up everything but the kitchen sink. It can pick up a frying pan in it's grip like it's nothing. A 7# triple ply stainless steel and copper pot was a breeze. You'll note in the photo that it was able to pick it up from just the side which is only 2mm thick thanks to the molded palm.

What was really cool was picked up a pen as an afterthought. Then it occured to me that I could just sit down and write a note with the hand. I shot a video of me doing it. The handwriting was a bit messy, but that was in large part because I was watching myself write through the viewfinder in my phone which was a bit disorienting. But who cares about the handwriting: the Raptor hand can take notes!

In future iterations I'd like to route the elastics through 1/4"" PEX tubing and mold the whole assembly inside of a molded Oogoo palm. This will protect the elastics, integrate a molded palm, and generally be fun to play with.

I'll be creating a more in depth posting of how this hand was built, and the engineering challenges it presents on a website that pointed me too. It's called http://buildinprogress.media.mit.edu/. It's sort of like instructables, but with a twist. It's purpose built to document a project while it's in progress, and most importantly to collaborate with others on the project. You can post pictures, designs, cad files, etc. Other contributors can post add in their own content and files as well.

What I'd love to see happen, is for all the disparate projects that are being worked on to have a home where they can be visible at http://buildinprogress.media.mit.edu/. It would be great to have a forum for projects, where we can collaborate with each other, and where projects will be documented for future e-nablers to see. That way, we can stop reinventing the wheel, and we can start cross pollinating ideas. Right now though, I'm off to bed!

Conclusion: I think the normally closed hand has real potential, but there is a lot of work left to be done.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+ErikdeBruijn/posts/KmNXnYwk5Ne,"Serendipity? I noticed irregularities on the inside of the gauntlet when I used the one with support built in. When we control the irregularities we could actually use that to create Velcro mating 3D printed surfaces. I remember that many years ago Bernhard Kubicek, a friend in the Ultimaker community has already made velcro compatible surfaces by crafting G-Code that will create tiny loops. I've also printed these droloop flowers designed by Peetersm recently and they will stick together (not on purpose) but it's similar to Velcro hooking together:
https://www.youmagine.com/designs/drooloop-flowers-customizable

Most interesting about them is that he uses STLs with specific settings in the slicer which is enough to create the velcro compatible loops (that will stick together with the hooks in velcro).

Another friend who used to treat patients feet (which have anatomical similarities) told me about gel cushioning material velcro compatible backing: http://www.algeos.com/m-gel_sheets_with_hook_backing-3mm_thick.html

For feet it reduces the chance of ulcers especially in older people who have less blood circulation. For a hand it might be less of a concern, unless you really use the hand all the time (e.g. carrying a load).

Thought I would share these photos with the community. I sent a failed palm print to my recipient. As I was wondering if it was going to fit; looks like it's going to be a bit tight on the left side near the thumb and the index finger.

I'm going to reply to my recipient asking them to add a ruler to the photos and ensure that everything is 90 degrees to each edge. So I'm able to measure the photo using the tracker. As the widest point is not across the knuckle; my original measurement. It's about 2-3 up from that between first and second holes of that set of 3 on the left hand side.

The file  was made by the hand-o-matic with a 5mm thinkness for padding, which if you look at the photos has worked on the right hand side and the front but not on the left due to enlarged index finger.
Will measuring the widest point to point enable the print to be larger and fit the enlarged index finger?
Could I use the original measurement and just increase the padding size to get the correct fit?

The oogoo that I typically make has a durometer of about 20-30. Since I was already playing with baking soda to neutralize the Ph, I was curious to see if it would be possible to trap a ton of air bubbles in the oogoo to make it into a foam.

To do this, I decided to add in a tablespoon of vinegar and a tablespoon of baking soda into my standard oogoo mix. Everyone who has ever been to a science fair knows that mixing vinegar and baking soda makes for tons of bubbles as the vinegar and baking soda combine to make water and Carbon Dioxide.

It worked, and it was an absolute ton of fun to do.

When it cured, the oogoo just about doubled in size, and has half the density of traditional oogoo. It retains the same great elasticity. It has a similar squishyness as a kitchen sponge! The vinegar smell was totally gone after 24hrs of curing, so I think it may be Ph neutral as well.This stuff is really cool, it's food safe, it's fun to make, and it's cheap as dirt. Take a look at the pics of the oogoo next to it's altoid tin mold. It puffed up just like baked bread :)

Maybe a more refined version has applications as a socket material, or as foam padding?

At any rate, I thought it was kind of neat so I thought I'd post it on here for posterity in the event that any does a search for ""Oogoo"" at some future date :)

I was inspired by +Melina Brown who was interested recently in a space filler for a partial foot in a shoe. +Steve Wood thought of oogoo and that got me thinking... :)

I am an intern working for the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology (TCAT) at the University of Washington. I have currently been working on combining 3D scans from smartphones with CAD models of devices so that people can integrate the specific topography of a body part with the model of what device they are going to be using. I am trying to make it as automatic as possible and so far the best  solution I've come up with is by using Solidworks Scan to 3D add-in to do most of the work. I used this method in order to get the shape of the top of a person's hand around the knuckles so that we can print out a hand splint for people with rheumatoid arthritis that fits as closely as possible to the hand.

  Has anyone else been working on integrating 3d scans with CAD files to fit topography into the CAD file for printing? If so how have you done it? I'd be very interested to see how people have tried to solve this task.

win some - lose some...

I have been playing around lately with ways to improve how the bungees connect.  I thought I had a really clever solution.  To be fair, it was sort of clever... but it didn't work at all.  Although that solution didn't work, I fell back to what I still consider an improvement.  I will outline both the failed version below (so that others don't need to repeat my mistakes) and also what I am doing on version 2 of my fingers.

The solution that I thought was clever involved a mechanism to allow any individual finger to be re-bungee'd and tensioned - in place, without any disassembly, and without any impact/dependence on any other finger.  The start of this was to include a tie-off for the bungee on the intermediate portion.  You can see that in the first picture.  I have improved this a bit in later versions.  Although this was part of the failed solution, it is a part that worked, so I am still using it on my next fingers.  The bungee then threaded through the knuckle block to a small indent.  A piece of printing filament was cut to sit in that indent.  One strand of the bungee went on one side of the filament rod, and the other strand on the other.  They were then tied together with a surgeon's knot.  So far, so good.  I built a test part and sure enough, it could be easily cabled in place.  What is more, tying the knot at approximately the right tension was easy because now both ends of the cord were free to make the knot.

The reason for all of this was that it provided a couple of ways to adjust tension.  If tension was way off, you could stretch out the rod and take another loop of cord around it before returning it to its slot.  You could then do fine adjustments by pulling it out and twisting it.  The idea was to make it work sort of like a torsion catapult.  Twisting did sort of work - in that it allowed a pretty precise control over the bungee tension.  The problem, though, was that the twisted bungees then had exposed ridges from the twists - and they caught in all kinds of places.  Because the bungees need to slide through the proximal joint, the catching was a show stopper.

I don't think there is a reasonable way to make this work.  I already expanded the hole sizes as large as they could go without it making any difference.  I thought briefly about maybe using some sort of sheathing around the bungees, but thought that going that route was resulting in too complex of a solution.

That all said, using the tie-off point on the intermediate finger, and then tying off to a post at the knuckle block still has a lot of benefits.  As I see it, the benefits are:

  *  No bungee hole in fingernail, so the finger prints better.
  *  No loose bungee end to secure through fingernail, so no possibility of the bungee end slipping into the hole and changing tension.
  *  No loose bungee end out of fingernail needing to be bound down, so no odd bumps in the rubber coating because of the bungee end.
  *  Able to replace a failed bungee quickly without replacing or removing a finger.
  *  Able to individually tension each finger rather than having the tension in two fingers linked together.
  *  It is possible to tie a good knot (surgeon's knot) since neither end of string is under tension during tie-off.
  *  It is very possible to set finger tension by pulling up the first double overhand portion of the knot and then checking tension before doing the second lock knot.
  *  Bungee run is shorter and more direct, making for less abrasive wear points or places where the bungee could bind.
  *  Elastic load is shared by two runs through the proximal joint, making it stronger and less prone to failure.

On the negative side:
  *  Bungee is more exposed at the intermediate attachment point.  I have set the rod down a little to reduce this, but it is still more exposure than when going out through the fingernail.
  *  Two runs of bungee means the hole in the proximal joint needs to be larger, and it could become a problem for small fingers.  My tests are generally adult sized.  I have a lot of room left, but maybe it would be a problem with very small hands...


I am probably going this route for the next hand I make for Chris.  If any of you have any feedback, it is always welcomed.  I have also made the fingers increase in height as you go from tip to knuckle block.  That looks a bit more natural, makes the fingers stronger, and provides a slight leverage advantage over the last version.  I am also going to modify these to allow pins as an option in the proximal-intermediate joint.  I think pins are a better solution than screws.  Happy to discuss why if anybody cares...  I also improved the shape of the intermediate portion to make it better accept 3M gripping material that I thought made a crazy big difference in the grip for the first hand.

I will, as always, post the parametric scad files for these.  Just like with the previous version, you can set a bunch of customizations - like the length of the digits.  They aren't out yet, because I am still tweaking a little.  If there is any feedback that leads to improvements, I would like to get that incorporated before putting them out in the wild.

Sorry about the length of the post.  Nobody ever accuses me of being overly brief - or even appropriately brief...

Here is my first stab at designing a tool to measure the efficiency of e-nable hands. I'm interested to learn which of the existing hand models do the best job of translating the wrist flexion of the user into a useful grip. In theory, all the hands should be the same, but there are some mechanical gremlins that get in the way:

1. Pin Friction: The snap pins in the Raptor, for example, are not smooth out of the box. Under load, they create a great deal of friction. On my hulk hand with a 10# spring, joints sounded like a pepper shaker grinding pepper when the fingers moved, even after sanding them for an hour up to 500 grit. This friction robs users of grip strength.

2. Tendon Friction: The tendon lines we use in very coarse, unsanded tendon holes generate friction. The standard nylon shade cord that comes in the Cyborg beast kit is about 1.5mm with a relatively coarse braid. Under load, those lines drag on the plastic, and waste a great deal of energy. The 0.5mm dyneema fishing line likely generates less friction under load. I'd like to measure the difference.

3. Elastic Losses: The elastics that we use to open the fingers consume grip strength. The user has to overcome the elastic resistance to close the grip. Because of Hooke's law, the more the fingers are closed, the more the elastics are stretched, and the harder it becomes to stretch them. They also generate friction while they're stretching. It may not seem like a lot of force to stretch, but our users don't have a lot of strength to begin with. I want to measure how much force elastics are consuming.

4. Other: There are lot's of forces at work in these hands we don't fully understand. Testing the hands on a standardized testing apparatus will really help shine light on these unknown, complex mechanical gremlins :)

The gizmo that I designed to measure these mechanical forces is generally terrible. It uses 2 turntables that turn independently of one another. The reason it does this is that as the fingers curl, the scale that's measuring the finger gripping force needs to spin around to stay perpendicular to the backs of the finger-tips. Turntables were the first things that I thought of to do this.

One nice feature of this design is that it uses a simple screw that is attached a scale, which is attached to the tendon lines of the hand. Turning the screw generates gripping force. You turn the screw until you've hit the precise input force you want (1kg). This allows you to control the forces you are putting into the hand in order to get a precise efficiency measurement (force in/force out).

Now that you know that you have exactly 1kg of tendon pull at the wrist, you take the measurement on the second scale, which is attached to the fingertips by a bar. This output will show grip strength. Let's say the second scale says 100grams. Now you can say that the fingers are operating at 10% efficiency (1kg at the wrist translates to 100grams at the fingertips)

Now you know that 90% of the potential gripping force is being consumed by mechanical gremlins. So you change out the plastic snap pins for Chicago screws. You dial it back up to 1kg of pull at the wrist using the screw. Now you're measurement is 125 grams at the fingertips. With the chicago screws, (hypothetically) you've increased the grip strength of the hand by 25%.

Now you take off the elastics, and swap in some Bowden cables. You dial it back up to 1kg at the wrist using the screw, and you take another measurement at the fingertips, which is 175grams. You've increased the grip strength vs the original (hypothetically) by 75% using by changing these 2 components.

Next you swap out the nylon shade cord, and swap in some .5mm 100# fishing line. You dial it back up to 1kg at the wrist using the screw, and take the measurement at the fingertips which is 200 grams. You've doubled the strength of the grip (purely hypothetically).

Using this tool, (or a much better future design) you can determine quantitatively exactly what effect each of the components has to the grip strength of the hand.

You can also play around and at 5kg or 10kg, at the wrist to see how increased force effects the friction, and the efficiency of the hand. I'd like to generate a grip force curve using 1kg, 2kg, 3kg, 4kg and 5kg.

My device is a terrible design, but everyone has to start somewhere. My motto is fail early, fail often, and fail better next time.

To see an incredible design by +Skip Meetze that is superior in almost every respect, take a look at this incredible testing tool for measuring grip efficiency:

https://plus.google.com/105069495767890395465/posts/CD7RfgpmjXe

Looking at Skip's design made my day! I think we're very close to coming up with a testing tool that multiple people can quickly build to start rigorously testing hands, and figuring out what will bring the best grip strength to e-nable hand users.

I'd love to see some other folks take a stab at this, or troubleshoot designs as they emerge. Let's get a standardized e-nable hand testing tool built, and start getting some hard numbers that we can use to evaluate our hands!

Goal: Create more non-printing volunteer roles that speed up the matching process.  Create a process that classifies cases into three categories (Straightforward, Needs Customization, Specialty Case) so printers/designers can match themselves according to ability, interest and printer size, in addition to geography.  It doesn't preclude one-on-one discussion or meeting with the recipient, but provides better feedback on the process for the recipient and Enable to track, and the option to pass the hand to an assembler if desired.

Curious for feedback.  Too complicated?  Better than stocking sizes?  What are the advantages/disadvantages over current system? 

For those who use bug/issue trackers - is there one that might fit E-nable's needs?  Free, multi user, requires web login for privacy, allow attachments.  Is this something that seems worthwhile to pursue?  Maybe it's well suited to a smaller beta as a proof of concept?  If this is too complicated, are there ways we could implement some of these ideas into the current system to deal with demand?

Basic Idea: I shoved a whippletree load balancer into a tensioner box.

Problems: The whippletree load balancer is great. It gives the hands an adaptive grip, so that each finger can adjust to a form fitting position for the object being picked up. However, there isn't a lot of room to put it between the tensioner box on our hands and the palm. Also, you have to tie the coords just right because the tensioner is behind it.

Goals: The whipple box puts the whippletree behind the tensioner, allowing you to assemble it, wire up the hand like you normally would, then adjust the tension like you normally would.

How it works: Each tensioner pin has it's own little tensioner box. You attach the screws to the backs of the individual boxes, then assemble the whole box. Once your hand is wired up, you insert your screwdriver/allen wrench through the hole at the back of the box and adjust the screws to tighten the pins. Snap on the cover, and you're done.

To do: Rework the chain links to be snap pins so this can be assembled in the real world. Add a guide rail over the thumb pin. Add a snap-on cover for the box.

Once I've finished these last steps, I'll print it out and see how it works.

It makes me feel like my small contributions are insignificant, so I've become inspired to do more and more for e-NABLE and for myself, starting with today in which I spent all day printing these electrically conductive parts for a 175% raptor hand that I'm using for R&D on my Spidey Sensor project.  

These parts (and the tensioner still printing) will form one ""plate"" of a human body capacitor that will sense objects both at a distance and through touch.  A speaker and/or vibration motor will report the sensory signal to the wearer, thus making e-NABLE hands ""feel"" something akin to the sense of touch - in some ways better and in some ways worse (but mostly better).  

What I like about this approach is that it is entirely practical using today's available technology and it's simple.  I have prototyped the initial version and it is robust and functional, plus also fairly inexpensive and otherwise practical.  To recharge, just plug in to USB.  To reprogram, to add functionality, just attach sensors and/or actuators to the available I/O with female headers for connectors, just plug into USB and run the Arduino IDE software.  

Adding the equivalent of an Arduino UNO board to an e-NABLE hand with extra unused I/O turns the hand into a development system that the recipients can program to do whatever they want, so in effect this Spidey Sensor addition turns an e-NABLE assistive device into a development platform for the recipient who is or would like to be a Maker.  

I'm going to try to get this thing working by Monday evening so I can demonstrate it in the R&D hangout.  Tune in for a progress report, whether I can get all the work done by then or not.

It is reposition-able into four positions determined by four notches.   To change the rate of closure the user just slides the CAM out a little to release it from the notch and rotates it to the next position. It is a little cumbersome to do while wearing the arm, because this elbow design requires the CAM be on the inside. Still this works pretty well. I have showed the CAM in three of the four positions.

Also I have redesigned this arm to have two string bowden channels one to each elbow. So the thumb is one one elbow and the fingers are on the other elbow. By adjusting the closure rate of the thumb and fingers separately, the wearer can achieve various grip types. 

Also I threaded the cuff itself. At 100% it is a 8mm-1.25 thread. The bolts are printed too, so if the arm is resized the bolts a resized to fit. The only problem is I have printed the bolts vertically. Normally I put a flat side on the bolt and print them on their side for better strength.  Has anyone had problems with bolts printed vertically shearing because of bad layer adhesion? I can print these bolts on their side, the nice big head just gets cut in half.

OK, we've settled on a name for our new offspring! The Raptor. Now we need your help with printing for the Johns Hopkins event!

The term ""raptor"" is derived from the Latin word rapere (meaning to seize or grasp).

Everyone's feedback has been tremendously helpful. We've incorporated a couple of fixes already, but we want to be very careful about making further changes until after the Johns Hopkins event, so some of the suggestions may be saved for later implementation.

We now want to ask for your help in printing parts for the upcoming Johns Hopkins conference. +Jen Owen and +Melina Brown (+Enable Matcher) are working on gathering sizing information for the recipients attending the event. We're building a spreadsheet to track those, and we'll need people to print the Raptor design in those specific scales once we have the details ready.

Meanwhile, we also need to print as many Raptor hands as possible at 130% scale. This will be for the other workshop, where medical practitioners learn to assemble the hands, so they don't need to be a particular size. 130% is small enough to fit on a single build plate, but large enough that it's not too hard to assemble.

Please print in PLA - any color is fine. We suggest a 0.2mm layer height and 35% infill.

We're going to ask that you send your prints to Johns Hopkins prior to the event. A shipping address will be provided shortly.

Remember - no need to assemble. Just print the parts and ship them out.

The files are still available here: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7IZ4iPA1DJZWnVHN2RtdnB5WlU&usp=sharing

If you have a 6x9"" build plate (or larger), and if you're feeling courageous, you can use the ""All parts at 130%, single build plate.stl"" file to print everything at once. Otherwise, all of the individual STL files are available as well.

We're not going to publish the files publicly until after the Johns Hopkins event, so please don't share these outside of e-NABLE for now.

When +Skip Meetze, +Jon Schull  and I visited +Jeff Erenstone  prosthetic workshop in beautiful Lake Placid NY, Skip brought along something he called ""PLA Plywoood"". It's printed flat on a printer bed, dipped in boiling water, and then formed over the recipients forearm. It's simple to do, and it's remarkably strong and flexible. My best guess is that it's 5x to 10x stronger than a traditionally printed gauntlet.

The difference between +Andreas Bastian  thermoform mesh and Skip's ""PLA Plywood"" is that Skip's material is a flat sheet with no holes, and Andrea's thermoform mesh is, well, a mesh with lots of holes in it. The objective of this post is not to compare the merits of the thermoform mesh, which is wonderful, vs the PLA Plywood, but rather to call attention to an interesting innovation (PLA Plywood) which folks might not have seen.

I'd love to give more details on how the PLA Plywood was printed, and why it works, but it's not my story to tell. I'll let Skip finish his experiments and post his printing methods, heating methods, and results. I will mention that it was originally intended that the PLA Ply be dipped in boiling water to heat it, similar to thermoform mesh.

Where things got really exciting is when Jeff put the PLA Ply in the oven to try to remelt it in order to form it over a plaster mold of a local recipients hand. Jeff put the gauntlet in the oven at 375 degrees in order to see how well it would take the tight compound curves of a hand mold. 

We intended to do it for about 5 minutes, but we forgot it was in there and it totally melted. We almost threw it in the trash, but we decided to try peeling it up and using it anyway.The result was something incredible.

Jeff formed the melted PLA over a plaster mold of a hand from a local recipient. It took the tight radius, compound curves with ease. It stayed pliable for several minutes as Jeff formed it over the mold. When it cooled, the strength was simply unbelievable. It was just 1/6"" thick, but I could barely bend it, let alone break it using both hands. It was easily 10x stronger than any PLA part I've ever printed. It was actually stronger than the thermoset carbon fiber that Jeff had also used on the same hand for the same purpose.

I think that there are a lot of applications for this stuff. It could be entirely possible to build an entire hand and gauntlet using this method. The resultant hand would be stronger, lighter, and cheaper than anything we have previously built. Here are some of it's virtues:

1. Prints in 1/3rd the time
2. Uses 1/2 as much material
3. Is 50% cheaper to print
4. Is dramatically stronger
5. Molded over a plaster mold yields a perfect fit.

Unfortunately, in my excitement over this stuff I only took 1 picture of it. I did however take several photo's of the plaster mold and the carbon fiber part we were trying to compare it to.

I'd love to get this material properly tested by someone like +Mark Deadrick  so we can get some real strength data on this stuff!

https://plus.google.com/u/0/115790229936940393119/posts/KTSqvaFAGYj,"From virtual Whipple Box to actual Grip Balance Box.

I've got a functional, printed version of what I'm now calling the Grip Balance Box. I loved the name ""Whipple Box"" because it let me say ""whipple"", but the name should describe what the part does, not what it's made of.

Pros: 

It works: As you can see from the pictures, a hand with a regular tensioner box does not engage all the fingers when picking up my glasses case. The red hand has a grip balance box and the fingers all push on the glasses case.

Raptor Gauntlet compatible: The base is the same size as the tensioner box on the Raptor Reloaded, so you can just substitue this, and it will work.

Cons:

It's huge: It's as wide as the Raptor Classic's tensioner box, as long as the Reloaded's box, and taller than both. When I look at it on a gauntlet I feel like missiles should shoot out. I started off shorter, but variances in printing required extra spacing tollerances. I think I can squeeze a couple of milimeters off the width, but I don't think I can do anything about the height.

It's a pain to wire up: With the regular tensioner box you have to hold the hand at the right angle while tying the knots to get the length of the cords right. Actually, you can just put a book under the palm. With this, I had to hold the hand and hold the whipple tree in place at the same time while getting the cords right. Also, there's only one tensioner, so you have to get each individual cord pretty close to the other three finger coords before you can tighten all of them. I started to feel like I had a trick for it by the end, but I'll have to practice a few times before I can describe the best way to wire it up.

It's weird: Getting all the parts to fit into the box got tricky. I ended up making the tensioner pin actually sink down into the sliding shoe. This means that once you put the box on the gauntlet and slide it into position, the whipple tree mechanism can not be slid out. That can make wiring a bit more tricky since you have to get the wires behind the wheel. You also have to have the retention clip off to put in the screw. I'm hoping those are all the consequences, but feedback is welcome.

Issues:

Size: I'm going to see if I can make it a little narrower, but that won't have a dramatic affect.

Part durability: I'm a little leery of putting the force of four fingers on one screw. I'm going to see if I can widen the tensioner pin and allow two screws to secure that one pin.

Conclusion:

Tiny, interlinking parts do not seem to be strength for 3D printing. I kept having to make parts bigger for strength and to account for variation in printing. In the end, I got the parts to work printing them at .2mm with 100%. I'm hoping that's a worst case scenario, since I'd suggest printing the inner parts at .1mm, and most hands will be bigger than 100%.

Feedback and ideas would be great. Is two screws for the tensioner a good idea? Any ideas for reducing the size? I'm going to do another round of adjustments. After that I should hopefully be able to put the files online and recruit some people to test it.

I've been trying to use solely SLS printed nylon that was printed by Shapeways. The Design is based on photogammetry of a 7 year old girls full and partial hands.

I'm trying to use 3D printed springs combined with pin joints to form the finger mechanism. With this design I thought I could get away with gluing the springs in place, but it hasn't worked out well at all.
Another issue is the mechanism that pulls on the tendons moves through an arc that doesn't actually pull the tendons that much, so I'll need to work on that too.

Actual cost to have the hand printed was 100 euros, so not going to challenge fdm printers soon on price, but there is arguably less post processing required. The detail level is also pretty good.

I have been in communication with +Jeff Erenstone who has furnished me with a recipient's scanned hand and some valuable information that he would like to see incorporated, so firstly, many thanks Jeff.

I made a variable density test print in Filaflex of the scanned residual hand with a ""solid"" core inner printed at 50% infill to replicate some bone structure. then the outer was printed with a loose 10% infill to represent the soft tissue of the skin and muscles. The result is fantastic and feels superbly realistic, it is hard to show in pictures or even a video but this has convinced me to follow this avenue for further testing. Maybe the Flexy-Hand fingers will have an internal ""bone"" mesh.

See my previous post for a video of this scanned hand being printed: https://plus.google.com/108714388018021121878/posts/dYE1Azf9Lqr

I design and printed a Flexy-Hand 2 body with an integral palm mesh. With Jeff's recommendation that this should be tried in Filaflex to help with conformity and comfort for the users residual palm. This is the first stab and it turn out really well, with a great fit.

The print was a bit challenging with the extruder ""machine gunning"" between the mesh gaps so I will re-design the mesh to only have a single vertical oval slit in the middle.

Happy New Year everyone.

My daughter Maggie is 8 yrs old and was born with a rare condition called VACTERL Association.  In short, VACTERL stands for : Vertebral, Anal , Cardiac , Tracheal, Esophaeal, Renal and Limb.  She was born with a shorten radius and no thumb on her right hand.  We saw an article about 3D printers in our local newspaper and it mentioned E-nable. So we thought we would try and ask here if anyone would be willing to make a hand device but  with a thumb (she already has the four fingers).  Without the thumb it makes it hard to grasp some things and she has to do it between her index and middle finger and at times this can be very uncomfortable for her.  There is surgery to 'fix' this problem but that requires the removal of the index finger and sliding it down , which would change her hand. Not to mention my daughter has had 15 surgeries in her short life,  this would be elective, and she does not want anymore surgery ( if we can help it).  I would love to see if this could help others born this way without having to resort to painful and expensive surgery.  If anyone is willing to take this on, please let us know.

I tried using the new Raptor Handomatic using the link provided by +Ro Ortiz a few days ago. The user interface has been streamlined, and it's beautiful to behold. The handomatic team has done some amazing work!

I'm building a thumbless left hand for my current recipient and I was really pleased to see that this option was built right into the handomatic. What I was really surprised to see was that my actual recipients photo was the default photo on the handomatic for the sizing instructions. I'm not sure how that occurred, but it struck me as a really good sign that it was going to work for him!

One change to this new handomatic for the raptor is that there is no ""pro"" version that takes all 20 measurements. There are only 2 measurement inputs available, taken from the user's unaffected hand.

This was initially a concern because my recipient has a much longer hand than usual. The initial palm that the handomatic produced was too short to fit him. At first, I wasn't sure what to do, since there was no ""pro"" version where I could put in the right measurements for his affected hand. Then I realized, I really only needed the two dimension inputs available. I could just change the length measurement from the actual measurements of my recipients hand, to a longer measurement.

I increased the length measurement, and kicked out a new set of STL files, and then imported them into Fusion360 to measure the resulting hand. It was a little too long, so I just repeated tweaking the measurement. On my 3rd try, I got a perfect fit!

The only thing that concerned me was that when I imported the STL's into ""Slicer"" to print them, they gave me an error saying that design wasn't ""manifold"" or ""watertight"". That seems like a problem. I'm not sure if this was issue with handomatic, slicer, or me.

Does anyone have an idea what went wrong or what I should do?

P.S. The handomatic is brilliant, and the folks working on it should get an award of some kind. My hats off to you ladies and gentlemen who have been working so hard to make this software possible!",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Modular Terminal Device by e-NABLE

The Gripper Thumb Hand is a Voluntary Opening (normally closed) Terminal Device (TD) for a prosthetic arm.   It is printed flat and then thermoformed so that the 4 fingers are fixed in a flexed grip.  The thumb pivots at the proximal end and is flexed under power of an elastic ring in order to contact the first two fingers in a “three-jawed chuck” grip. The grip is opened by a Bowden cable that is pulled by an elbow or shoulder action.  

The Gripper Thumb Hand incorporates a 1/2 inch  (or M12) fine-thread bolt for connection at the wrist of a prosthetic arm.  It can replace the commonly used split hook of a conventional prosthetic arm or it can attach to the experimental Modular Training Arm system being developed by e-NABLE.

I've spent the past month or so building parametrically-driven models of the Raptor Reloaded proximals and distals.  These models can be manipulated by a script to populate a lookup table with every scale value and perfect clearances.  Furthermore, entire tables can share different levels of clearance, making machine-specific tuning viable.  Overall, this should effectively stop problems with snap pins from falling out and should greatly reduce noise problems.  

I see these lookup tables as the next step for Handomatic, particularly for support of new hands.  I've done a good bit of testing on the Raptor Reloaded and am now close to have a working parametric model of the Phoenix proximal (not yet the thumb).  The lookup table method could serve accurately-scaled STLs rapidly without turn around time for a server to compile openSCAD.  From a user experience standpoint, there would be little difference between a lookup table and a dynamic geometry generator on the backend.  I have some thoughts that I am writing up about how I think this should all fit together.  Will share shortly.  

I'm pretty happy with the motion and clearances across scales when printed on my rep2, but would like feedback about larger scales across other machines.  Please feel free to print out the 200% (we'll see the most pronounced effect at this size) phalanges, distals, and regular snap pin and experiment.  I haven't separated radial clearances from lateral clearances in the phalanges, but it would be straightforward to do if testers observe marked differences between the radial pin fit and the overall joint clearance.  

After building parametrics fro the Phoenix hand, I'd like to make the Gripper Box parametric so that specific kit-included screw sizes can be used.

If you have already had your test hand approved by either ECF or a mentor in the community -  Please go to the new badging system page and claim your ""TEST HAND APPROVED"" badge by submitting evidence of your device passing and we will approve your badge. The link to that specific badge is here: https://credly.com/claim/101276

To claim your badge:
Step 1. Sign up for a Credly account: https://credly.com/
Step 2: Follow the link to the ""TEST HAND APPROVED"" badge above.
Step 3: Click on ""Claim this badge""
Step 4: Submit your ""proof"" and show a screenshot of an email notification or link to a notice that states your test hand was approved by ECF or another member of the e-NABLE Community in conversation or in the forums etc.
Step 5: Please make sure you submit your email address as well when you submit your proof. There is a space for adding text to your list of proof.

We ask that you also leave your email address when you request your badge so that Jon can include you in his database to show how many approved makers we have and make sure you are included in the development of a matching system, potential filament reimbursement and award systems and impact-testing research. 

2. Please visit the updated ""Get Involved"" page on the http://enablingthefuture.org website - HERE: http://enablingthefuture.org/get-involved/

3. Note that there is a new process for submitting Test hands for those that hope to eventually become e-NABLE Chapter members or individual makers who may find themselves asked to create a device for someone in need!
We now have a new section on the forums for submitting test hands via photos and videos. You can find that link here: http://forums.e-nable.me/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=5947

4. Please also note that I have just released the new badging system. You can find them here: https://credly.com/u/enablethefuture - and if you click on ""Claim Now"", you will be able to view the currently available badges and please make sure to check back from time to time as I start adding more. (If you have ideas for badges that you would like to see, please let me know!)

5. If you are a recipient or recipient parent/guardian that is seeking a device for your child/yourself or were previously on the Enable Community Foundation's wait list - please visit the Chapters page and see if there is a chapter near you and if not and you require assistance - feel free to ask here in the Google+ group and we have numerous volunteers who are eager to help!

6. There has been discussion from some of our members on potentially creating a ""Virtual Chapter"" or two - in EU and USA and potentially other areas where those that are individual volunteers who seek matches but do not have the ability to create a local Chapter in their area - might create what we would call ""e-NABLE Guild Chapters"" that would be manned by volunteers themselves and then listed on the e-NABLE Chapter's map as an alternative to physical chapters - in case there are recipients who are not near any of our other chapters and need a volunteer to create their device for them. 

Do we have any volunteers who might be interested in creating and being responsible for a few ""Virtual"" e-NABLE Chapter Guilds and man them and respond to recipient requests that may come through there? Please email me at jen.owen.enablevolunteer@gmail.com if you are!

7. I believe that this new chapter of e-NABLE will bring even more opportunity than before for more individual makers to create useful tools for those in need - as we seek to expand beyond simply making hands, but also tools for those who suffer from stroke, arthritis and other hand challenges, create task specific tools and delve into the world of creating assistive tactile tools for the visually impaired and classrooms of children who need them. We are going to need all of you who can participate - to do so!

8. If you were previously an ECF School or University chapter and would like to list yourselves on the Community Chapter's page - please do so! We would love to have you join us! - You can find the link for chapters here: http://enablingthefuture.org/e-nable-community-chapters/

If you have any questions or suggestions - please feel free to tag me, +Jon Schull or +Shashi Jain and we will get back to you as soon as we can.

Now...go claim some of those badges and let me see the Enable The Future Badge system light up with awards! :D

This post is mainly addressed to material scientists.

I am a Masters' student in Estonia. I am working on developing a new material that would be suitable for using in Fusion Deposit Modeling based 3-D printing. The main raw material that I use is Polyamide-12 that is left over from SLS process. Since this material cannot be used in the same process again, I am trying to find a good use for it instead it just being discarded. 

Two of the goals of my project are to be more green and to bring FDM printing material price down. I would love to give it a try to develop a high-performance polymeric material that is suitable for 3-D printing prosthetic limbs. I read that e-NABLE mainly uses UHMWPE as the main material; does a material developed from recycled Polyamide-12 powder sound realistic to use for prostheses in your opinion? If yes, then would you be willing to spare me some of your time and knowledge to advice me on which specific characteristics you are looking from a prosthesis' material, are there any improvements you are looking forward to, etc?

I would like to co-operate with e-NABLE. I see that the main cost on producing those limbs is the material since the rest is based on voluntary work. It would be great if that cost could also be brought down and even more people in need would have an access to prosthetic limbs.

Please let me know what you think of my idea. And feel free to ask me any questions.

Best Regards,
Piret",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

This is still very early but here are some details on my progress with the powered standard Raptor (printed at 100%).

I printed a very basic bracket for a single RC servo (http://netram.co.za/1699-servo-medium.html) that can be fixed to the gauntlet. Then I also printed a small fitting that fixes the servo shaft to the outer side of the palm without having to make to many changes to the standard palm. I made the palm and gauntlet holes slightly larger, so that the printed part could fit nicely, and then I made a sunken slot into which the rectangular part could fit. (I think the photos and video explain the concept better than my words do).

As you can see from the video, the servo does not provide enough torque for the hand to close (it's rated at about 3kg.cm at 5V), which is why I have to help every time I give the instruction to close. This means either two servos should be used if I keep the servos in the same configuration, or I have to find an alternative to servos, i.e. small geared dc motors. I'm inclined to go for the second option because of two reasons:
1. these servos are very finicky and not a very neat solution, IMO. The problem is finding smaller motors with higher torque ratings at the same price. Any ideas?
2. Having two servos back to back would necessitate more space, which means a larger palm and gauntlet, which means the powered option would only be valid for teenage or adult recipients and not for children. This is not ideal.

Another thing that I want to do for the next iteration is to move the servos and bracket to the palm side. Not sure why I didn't think of this in the first place. More suggestions are welcome.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
https://plus.google.com/u/0/+PeregrineHawthorn/posts/YG5JYbqGgP6,"So, I just got my new Cyborg Beast from +Jen Owen today, and this is VERY interesting. There are a lot of differences I didn't expect at all.

By far, the biggest difference is the fit. The Talon focuses on keeping a good fit on my paw, with a relatively loose and flexible hold on my forearm. This is the exact opposite, with a very strong grip on my forearm, particularly on the underside closest to the elbow, and on the top closer to the wrist, but my paw just sits in the palm, loose until I use the fingers. This feels really nice for my paw, but I feel like it would be rough on my arm. I can't help but feel that the shifting bones when I rotate my arm would put pressure in bad places, maybe pinching nerves. I think that's mostly from the high, almost pointy arch that the bracer makes. It pushes in on the side, but my arm rarely makes any significant contact with the top before the sides of my arm are already uncomfortably tight against the center of the 'hourglass' shape. 

As for grip strength, I'm enjoying the cables that can take tight corners easily, and the rigidity of the design. My wrist correlates EXACTLY with the finger movements. The only issue I have with it, is that a lot of finger movement correlates with only a little wrist movement. It doesn't take much force to pry something out of my grip. 

I rather like the tensioning system used. I've got no fault with it, though I haven't tried to adjust it yet.

Another thing of note, is that, when fully extended, the back of the top of the hand bumps into the top of the bracer in a way that prevents any chance of pinching skin, which is nice.

I haven't used it hard enough to break anything yet, but I'll let everyone know as soon as I do.

Hello folks!

If anyone would like to make use of this, I've released a cable tensioner on Thingiverse. Thank you to Frankie and David; the ideas on tensioners that you shared were the basis of this design. Since this could be applied to mulitple designs, I made it without any mounting hardware. Instead, the STL file for the block can be imported into design software and then attached to a base, which is what I did with Peter's cable anchor base in the picture. I used Tinkercad to remove the set-screw setup that was there, imported the tensioner block and added it to the design and exported the result.

Here is a video explaining the tensioner: http://youtu.be/lO3zUPWro5A

I think this is because of the fact that his hand measurements as measured from wrist to fingertip is quite long compared to the ""average"" case. As I mentioned above, he has a full hand, and short fingers (17mm). I suspect that this may be tricking the Hand-O-Matic into think that his palm should be very large, rather than very long.

I've attached the picture below to show you what I mean. It seems to me that the palm component is too large. I think that the tendon holes should probably be close to co-planer, but you can see that the tendon holes on the palm component are much higher than the tendon holes on the gauntlet.

This is my first hand of any kind, and I'm a bit of 3d printing novice. I want to build Ethan the best hand possible, so I wanted to get some feedback from some veterans on how best to resolve the problem (if indeed there is one!). Does this look right?

I spoke with +Melina Brown about the issue and her advice was that I reach out to the community for advice, especially from seasoned veterans like +Jorge Zuniga , +Jeremy Simon, +Adam Carson , and +marc petrykowski.

The disadvantage is that you can't adjust each wire. You have to get them about right from the start. However, there will be four knots for four fingers instead of eight, plus you don't have to get them completely perfect because there's still an overall tensioner in the back.

The big advantage is space. My original whipplebox design kept getting bigger as I tried to make the parts big enough. This one has the same base as the Raptor Reloaded box, so it can simply be swapped out.

It doesn't even have too many parts. The standard tensioner box has six part, a box and five pins. This will have eight once I add a box cap, and I think assembly should be pretty obvious. Here's the layout.

On the bottom is the tree base. It has three poles and a snap pin built in.

On that you put two wheels and a swiveling tensioner pin. The tensioner pin has a rail on the bottom which fits a groove in the box. That will keep the whole thing in line.

One top of that is the snap-on tree cap.

That's not too hard, right? The wire from the first finger goes around a wheel and down to the second finger. Ditto for the third and fourth finger. The thumb gets a standard tensioner pin. You screw in that pin and the tree pin to get the wires to the right tightness.

So that's version 2. I'll try printing it out this afternoon. I love the suggestions that the first whipplebox generated, so feel free to add to this point.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Apparently push/pull lines are called Bowden cables :). I guess I'm about 110 years late to the party on that one.  It also sounds like some folks were experimenting with them this summer  (+Bob Roth and +Alex Thomas).

I figured that since I resurrected an old topic, I might as well take a stab at implementing the Bowden cable into a hand.

I stopped off at the hardware store on my way home from work and picked up some 1/4"" OD and 1/2"" OD tubing. This is obviously incredibly oversized for the task, but it's what the hardware store had  in stock.

The whole mess is covered in electrical tape, so I'll try to describe what I was trying to accomplish.

The most challenging part of the Bowden cable setup using 1.5mm weed-wacker line is the bridge between the palm and the tensioner. When you try to push the WW line forward by flexing the wrist up, the WW line wants to bend up into a bow rather than pushing forward into the fingers. The WW line is plenty strong enough for the job, but it's a tricky business to overcome this palm/gauntlet bridge hurdle with the Raptor's current design.

The solution I came up with to this problem is something I call a double Bowden tube. I'll describe how I did with tubing, and then describe how it would be done in actual practice.

To start off, I taped a piece of 1/4"" OD pneumatic tubing that spanned the full length of the palm and gauntlet when the wrist was flexed all the way back. Then I taped a piece of 1/2"" OD pneumatic tubing about 2.5"" long to the gauntlet itself.

When the wrist is bent all the way back (fingers open), the 1/4"" OD tube reaches all the way back to the end of the 1/2""OD tube at the rear of the gauntlet.

When the wrist is bent all the way forward to close the fingers, the 1/4"" OD tube glides forward 2"" so that the end of the small tube is .75"" from opening of the large tube.

So there you have it. A Bowden tube within a Bowden tube, and you have your bridge. There was surprising little friction, the whole assembly is all slick plastic that seemed to just glide forward and backward.

In actual practice, that's a lot of unnecessary tubing. The design modifications to the Raptor would be as follows:

Enclose the tendon cables on the top of the Raptor palm. This creates a channel for the WW line to ride in and keeps it from bowing up rather than pushing forward. At the top of the palm, where there are currently the 5 tendon guides, the holes would stay, but would slightly be enlarged 2.5 mm to receive the small bowden tube bridge between the palm and gauntlet. The Bowden tube would be inserted into this and glued into place with superglue. It doesn't receive any tension or do any real work, so just tiny bit of superglue is all that would be necessary to hold it in place forever.

On the Gauntlet, the Owen's tensioner would be removed entirely. In it's place, would be a slightly raised box about 6mm higher than the gauntlet walls. In this box would be 5 holes that were 3mm in diameter which the small Bowden tube would slide in and out of when the wrist was flexed forward and backward (thus replacing the large tube you seen in the video).

The weed-wacker line would be probably be crimped into place at the end of the finger. It would also be crimped at the end of the gauntlet. Tying knots in WW line is a lousy way to spend an evening. The cheapest, easiest way I could think to crimp was to just squish a small washer with pliers. It's cheap, easy and effective. For the prototype, I just used a set screw because it was quick, but I don't think that's a good long term solution. You could also shell out $6.00 for some fishing leader crimpers and another penny or two for the crimps

Conclusion: The bridge worked. All you'd need to do to the raptor is enclose the tendon slots in the palm, enlarge the tendon guides at the top of the palm, add in 5 cents worth of 2.5mm plastic tubing, and add lower profile tensioning box with 3mm holes in the gauntlet. Not too much of an overhaul.

I'm not suggesting that this is the best way to do it, over even a particularly good way to do it, but it glides like butter, and it's a cheap solution. It would add a lot more strength into the grip vs the elastic solution, especially when the fingers were all the way closed. Another nice feature is that the gauntlet would be significantly shorter, without the missile launcher shaped tensioning system rising high above the gauntlet; I think it would be low enough profile to wear under a long-sleeve shirt and not leave any lump.

In any event, that's my stab at the Bowden cable configuration. It's not pretty, but it worked. I'd love to see some other thoughts on how to tackle the problem.

I saw some posts about 3 phalanx fingers and I want to share my vision on the subject as I am currently experimenting with it.

The model I am working on will be a derivative of the Raptor. As one might see I used the differential components designed by Steve Wood in the rendered model (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:392970), which works great by the way. 

Well, I made the complete model and I noticed a compromise had to be made between tension in the fingers and a reasonable amount of force exerted to make the hand grasp. Replacing all the metal parts with wooden plugs was not the answer and neither was minimizing friction induced by the tendons. I think a properly functioning 3 or even 4 phalanx finger can work if the tendons are attached in a more human way. This must be vague for some, but that is what is basically done in a lot of mechanical hands these days, with levers instead of chord.

Anyway, I will look after it because the model below works quiet good  and human like, aside from the massive amount of force required to make it function as intended...

Thanks a lot for your time and this wonderful initiative e-NABLE.

For me this is critical to getting nice range of motion, particularly when the whipple tree is in the hand and it is difficult to tighten up a line after the arm has been used by the recipient. 

The key point when pre-stretching the line is to put more weight on it then the line will receive in use, but not enough to break it.

In the past, I've talked a great deal about how much potential gripping force the black finger return elastics consume. I've speculated that they might waste as much as 50% of the total potential gripping force that a small child with low wrist strength can generate.

Since I now have my trusty grip efficacy testing rig assembled, I thought it might be helpful to stop speculating and put some real numbers to this.

My methodology for testing this is pretty simple. I rigged up the hand so that all of the finger tensioning cables were attached to a single zip tie. I then attached a highly accurate scale to the zip tie, and measure the force required to close the fingers on a normally configured v1 Raptor. This gives me a measurement of the force necessary to close the fingers with the elastics in place.

Note: I was very careful to configure the elastics so that they were pre-tensioned the absolute minimum amount required to open the fingers. I spent about 90 minutes doing this, so it's as close to minimum elastic force as I can get. I'm guessing the average assembler doesn't put this much time or thought into elastic tension, so it stands to reason that an average hand is actually much worse than the results below.

To test the force required to close the fingers without the elastics, I just snipped the elastics off with a pair of wire cutters and removed them with some needle nose pliers.

I took a video of both test so folks could see for themselves.

Results:

4 Finger Hand With Elastics: Peak force = 2.2 lbs
4 Finger Hand Without Elastics: Peak force = 0.18 lbs

So there you have it. The 4 elastics consume about 2lbs of force. Note that my hand only has 4 fingers (no thumb). My best guess is that the thumb elastic also consumes about .5lbs of pull force like the other fingers. If that's the case, my estimate for a 5 fingered hand is as follows:

5 Finger Hand With Elastics: Peak force = 2.7 lbs (estimated)
5 Finger Hand Without Elastics: Peak force = 0.23 lbs (estimated)

Assuming a small child with weak wrists is only capable of generating 5lbs of wrist flexion, a five fingered hand with elastics would consume 2.5lbs or roughly half his total potential gripping force.

It's an easy experiment to reproduce with a $12.00 scale from Amazon.com This is the scale I used:

http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-AMW-SR-5-Digital-HanGinG/dp/B003SWZWNC/ref=pd_sim_k_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0YVBCC2MMNEEEBDAFNK8

At any rate, my point is that the little black elastics that we use consume a surprising amount of potential grip force. This is especially relevant in the case of small children with minimal wrist strength (which incidentally, is the majority of the recipients!)

I'm curious to hear if anyone has ideas on how we might improve this.

Also, I'd love to see other folks give measurements of different hands like the Cyborg Beast, Flexy Hand 2, Ody Hand, or Talon. It's just $12.00 to find out how your own hand performs on this test!

So I was curious to see how well the laminated Oogoo fabric actually worked. It felt pretty strong tugging on it, and the lamination had great adhesion between layers, but there is only so much force I can generate with my hands.

To give it a more rigorous torture test, I snipped the Oogoo fabric with sharp scissors to replicate a 1"" tear, then drilled a hole in it with a 1/8"" diameter drill bit. I put a wood screw through the hole, and backed it with a small washer. I then tied 15lbs of cast iron weights to the screw, and suspended the whole assembly from my basement ceiling. 100% of the weight of the cast iron was pulling directly against the simulated tear.

Amazingly, the screw didn't pull through, and the fabric lamination didn't tear. That's a whole lot of force. I don't think just regular Oogoo would have held more than 1lb before the screw pulled through or it tore in half.

Conclusion: Laminated Oogoo fabric is more than strong enough to be affixed mechanically to a palm, or anything else for that matter.

What if some of the popular hand/arm designs had a ""standard"" that made it really easy to completely customize hands with the desired tensioner, fingers, palm, etc., without having to modify the 3d files at all (excluding scaling.)  From the tests I've done, it's already really easy to use different people's designs together without making changes in many cases, but imagine what it would be like to have an ""e-Nable customizer"" where users could actually mix and match the different components and, using the right sized hardware, just assemble everything without trouble.
The biggest problem with this is that, unless every design is parametric, scaling a finger to the appropriate size, for instance, is going to change the size of any bearings, bolts, and cabling you're using.

Happy Friday everyone!
I decided to play with the 'utility hand' project yesterday, where I had previously just removed the finger sections from a Raptor.
 
Allowing us to build custom accessory mounts for projects where fingers may get in the way. Drawing, painting, eating, or job specific tasks for adults. Maybe an adult wants to paint their house, he can mount a large paintbrush on here, and not get his good hand dirty, that kind of a thing.


I have NEVER played with design software with anything bigger then the simple Wolverine claws, so this is a learning experience for me.

Tinkercad is my friend, I like the simple 'paint by numbers' look to it lol. 

I had been using the raptor palm,  But wanted to try and remove all the added holes, I ended up pretty much redoing most of the palm instead.

Thankfully the design is simple enough, I can customize the look for our kids, this one looks kind of mean, I was going for the PYTHON angle, but I could do a lot of other designs with it too. Maybe tiger paw, or polkadot, etc... or just basic utility palm.

I recently took a look at the Falconv1 hand on thingiverse. I had never seen it before. If you haven't seen this hand, you should take a few minutes to have a look. It's pretty incredible. I'd go into detail in the number of ways that it's incredible, but you'll be able to see for yourself pretty quickly. +Adam Arabian and his team should be really proud of this one.

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:418398/#files

Of the many wonderful features of the hand, the one that stuck out the most is the by far the simplest. Dental elastics!

The hand uses dental elastics to return the fingers to the fully open position in lieu of the black elastic cord that we use. There are several benefits to this:

1. Efficiency: The black elastics that we use to return the fingers to an open position consume a surprising amount of energy. This is especially true when picking up small objects, which requires the fingers to fully close. This is because of Hooke's law which roughly states that the force required to stretch an elastic or spring increases the more you stretch it. Our recipients, especially small children, have very little wrist strength to begin with. They need to translate as much of that limited force as possible to gripping. I think it's likely that the elastics consume as much as 50% of the total potential gripping force that a small child can produce! I believe that elastic bands are substantially more efficient, because they do need to stretch the full length of the finger. After the proximal phalange has made it's full 90 degree rotation, there is no additional stretching. We need to build a testing apparatus to confirm this, but it's intuitive that the elastic bands consume dramatically less energry. That means more gripping strength available to our little recipients to use their hands more effectively.

2. Assembly Time: One of the criteria that I think it is important to measure a hand by is the assembly time required. It takes about 10-15 minutes to thread and tie off the elastic cord. It takes just 10-15 seconds to slip on 5 elastic bands.

3. Maintenance: The black elastic cord that we use stretches out over time and loses it's elasticity. Before long, the recipient is going to need to replace it. Currently, they'll have to find a source for the elastics, pay for shipping, watch the video on how to install them, and then spend the 10-15 minutes to replace them. Dental elastics are simplicity themselves to install. Even a 7 year old boy can figure out what needs to be done and get the job done in under a minute. Additionally, every orthodontic office in the country has drawers full of these things, and would likely give them away for free.

4. Kitting: For the Raptor hands, I think it would be great to do a very simple kit that contains the tensioning cord and elastic. To make a kit currently, it's necessary to measure out the elastic, cut it with scissors, roll it up in a coil, and place it in a plastic bag. With elastics, it's possible to just grab 10 of them and stick them in a bag. Because the elastic bands are so light, they also cost less to ship. I think a full Raptor kit with padding foam, dental elastics, and tension cord could be shipped in a regular envelope for just 49 cents here in the US.

In short, that's my long winded plug for using dental elastics on Raptor v2, and future hands that our talented hand designers are working on.

Those are the benefits that I see to using elastics, and I can't think of any drawbacks. Can folks think of ways in which the elastics cord is superior to dental elastics for returning fingers to the fully open position? I'm sure there are some, I just can't think of them at the moment.

Im a new member to E-Nable, and had the good fortune of viewing a recorded session of the google R&D Hangout on the 29th of September. Some key points I took from the conversation:

1. Revision/Version Control
This is a very common issue in design environments. At my old job, we solved this with product lifecycle management, which tracks revs and also who made the revision. We could look into some of the open source versions out there and see if that meets our needs. That said, maybe somebody like Dassault Systems could donate a few licenses to E-Nable considering the scope of work you guys do. 
I have another solution as well, which involves the use of part/assembly configurations. I have used configs in SolidWorks and Pro-Engineer (Now Creo) before, and its a great way of working upwards of a base model. Let me know what you guys think. I could start on something like that on SolidWorks which would entail:
1. A base model (one we all agree on, which is basically the starting point of our design)
2. Changes done in the form of additional configurations.
3. This will keep all part/assembly data in one part/assembly and will help keep track of changes. We can figure out how to name the configs. An example naming convention could be:
CONFIG NUMBER_PERSON MAKING THE MODIFICATION_DATE
such as
C_TALHAHASAN_2014.10.1

I also took a keen interest in the dicussion regarding locking and actuation mechanisms. I have a few ideas and am going to start work on them today. I will keep you guys posted on any progress I make, and possibly share some images of my designs for critique.

I was thinking about grip strength last night and it occurred to me that grip strength is just a small part of grip quality. (This stuff is all new to me)

One of the things about the fingers I'd never really thought of before is that the soft tissue plays a big role in grip quality by increasing the surface area of the grip.

When I hold my phone tight, the skin/muscle actually conform around the shape and dramatically increase the surface area of the grip, and the friction of the grip.

The little silicon finger sleeves that we put over the fingertips, help, but I'm curious to experiment a bit.

My idea is to build a crude skeletal fingers in fusion360, stick it in a mold, and pour one of Smooth-Ons soft, durable urethanes into the mold over the finger. I'd want something close to the Durometer of an actual human finger. I'm thinking 3mm thick of urethane would do it.

The best part is, I think it should be possible to 3d print the actual mold for the fingers on the same plate as the fingers themselves. It would be pretty cool to be able to print a skeletal finger, print the mold shell, and then pour a few ounces of 2 part urethane, and wind up with a more lifelike, human grip. I bet it would only $1 or so to the cost of a hand.

This stencil was designed to simplify the process of making the bracer portion of any hand requiring leather. All you do is give it the circumference of the arm on either end of the bracer, and the distance between the two measurements, and the Thingiverse Customizer spits out an STL that can be printed into a stencil for cutting out a simple bracer shape.

This makes the hardest part of making a leather bracer as easy as putting string up to a ruler. I hope we can simplify the leatherworking process further to make it more accessible. Of everything I've tried, leather is the most comfortable and most effective thing I've tried, and I'd like to see more people using it.

And in some cases we are finding it quite hard to determine whether a modified hand design will work or whether an arm would be necessary.

The photos show the hand of a girl looking for the correct device. She has some (but slight) movement in her wrist and pretty much no residual palm. But I am hesitant to go for an arm immediately, also taking into account the many awesome designs that our volunteers have created for similar situations. Could we get some advice from volunteers who have previously helped recipients with similar cases? I know some of you have printed solutions and it would be great if you already have some feedback from the recipients on how your designs perform.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/110736851786370579318/posts/eT98NQsCmn9,"Constant Force Springs:

Building a normally closed hand actuated by strong elastic tubing highlighted for me the unfortunate implications of Hooke's law, which states that the more you stretch a spring (or elastic) the more force it requires (thanks +Nick Parker). It's pretty obvious, and anyone with an ounce of common sense understands this intuitively, but I had to build a normally closed hand to fully understand how poor my design was.

The trouble with my configuration with the elastics in the palm is that the hand had very little gripping strength in the fully closed position, and took increasingly huge forces to open the fingers to full extension.

Putting the elastics in the palm seems like a pretty good spot for a couple of reasons though.

1. If you put the elastics on the top of the gauntlet, like I did with the ""speargun raptor"" it will tend to pull the wrist backwards as well as pulling the grip closed. This can be overcome by a latching mechanism on the hinge, or a stop block between the top of the palm and the gauntlet, but these are hardly elegant solutions.
2. I want to have a molded palm anyway, and it seems like a waste of space and weight to have the full palm be Oogoo. Why not embed 1/4"" PEX tubing through the molded palm, with the elastics going through the tubing. You save weight, and protect the elastics.

That said, because of Hooke's Law, this is a pretty lousy place to put elastics, which became obvious as soon as I had built the hand!

Thankfully, there is an exception to Hookes Law. That exception is the constant force spring. As the name would imply, this is a spring that exerts exactly the same force no matter how far you stretch it.

This is wonderful for my normally closed hand configuration with the springs in the palm, because it means that I can achieve exactly the same gripping force through the full range of motion of the fingers. Nifty!

I plan to stack 4 small ones in the palm, embedded within the Oogoo molded palm protected by a plastic housing. I want to have mounds in the palm anyway, why not put something in them? This will be pretty neat to try.

They only cost about $2.00 each, and can generate 1lb of force, and come in a diameter less than an 3/4"". One lb of force per finger may not sound like much, but I think it's way more gripping force than current fingers are capable of exerting.

Even more interesting, it will be possible to vary the size of the springs for each finger. The thumb, forefinger, and pinky may get the strongest springs, and the two middle fingers somewhat less. I think this could generate a variety of grip configurations more efficiently, although it's possible it will just cause the fingers to close at a different rate. I guess I'll find out.

But there's one more really interesting application for these springs. The current black elastic that we use for all our hands to open the fingers are not terribly efficient. Because of Hooke's law, they consume an increasing amount of force to elongate the further the grip is closed. That problem can be solved by constant force springs.

It wouldn't be necessary to use 5 of them. A single spring could be secured in a small housing in the top of the palm and connected multiple opening tendon lines. These springs come in very tiny sizes. This way, the same resistance would be experienced by the user regardless of how far the grip closed. And what's more, it will be possible to size the spring with great precision. A 180% scaled hand will need a different spring than a 65% scaled spring for a 4 year old. This may violate the ""easily sourced"" ethos, but I'm very curious how much more efficient it could make the hands, especially for small children with very little wrist strength.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/110736851786370579318/posts/83zM1sdjnDB,"The 25 Cent Oppositional Palm:

So I was thinking about grip dynamics this afternoon while I was watching the NY Jets game. If you're a Jet's fan, you understand why I wanted something to take my mind off the game :)

In any event, I started thinking about the importance of the palm when gripping. Our own palms do a lot of work when picking up large objects. Try picking up a a waterglass by just the rim without using your thumb to see one example of what I mean. Your fingers can grip this wide object by pressing the glass between your fingers and your palms. Our prosthetic hands can't do this.

The palm of the Raptor is flat. The only gripping surface on is the slippery back part of the velcro that secures the user's actual palm. This offers no friction grip, and no mechanical grip. You can see in the pictures above how I set about improving this.

The material I used is called Oogoo. It's pretty awesome stuff. All you need to make it is a tube of normal 100% Silicon that you find in any hardware store, and cornstarch. Ironically, the expensive type II silicon doesn't work; the stuff you need is the dirt cheap, $3.00 a tube stuff. You squirt 2 parts silicon out of a tube into a plastic cup, and then add in 1 part cornstarch. The cornstarch acts as a catalyst, and allows you to cure any thickness of silicon incredibly quickly. You stir it with a Popsicle stick until it is fully mixed. After about 4 minutes, it starts to set. It can be molded like clay in this formulation. Alternatively, you can add in a bit of mineral spirits and get a pourable version. You can probably do 10-15 palms with one tube. So it only cost about 25 cents to do a palm.

I formed the rather ugly palm above in about 2 minutes on a piece of wax paper. It was essentially cured after about an hour. You can see from the pictures how it transforms the gripping ability of the palm. The hand in the pictures isn't fully built, in fact, it's held together by drinking straws rather than snap pins. You get the general idea of how the gripping action works just the same.

What really interests me is the potential of printing out palm molds and finger molds right on a build plate. A pourable version of Oogoo would be ideal for this. You'd print the fingers in ABS, and you'd print the mold. You'd take the fingers off the build plate, snap them into place right in the mold, and pour Oogoo into the perfectly scaled mold. Likewise, you'd pull the palm mold off the plate, pour in the Oogoo, and have a ready made high friction, highly elastic, gripping palm and grippy fingers in 5 minutes, for less than the cost of a pack of gum.

The palm I designed above has exaggerated bumps, and probably isn't the best design. I think a more anthropomorphic palm could be designed. Or perhaps more bumps smaller in diameter and height is the right solution. The great thing is that any shape can be created quickly, easily, and cheaply to experiment with what works best.

I think Steve Woods would be the first to point out that this same end could be accomplished using Filaflex, which is marvelous stuff that I wish more of us could print. I guess my overall point is that the palm is a weak point in our existing designs that I think we could easily improve.

I'd love to hear what guys think. Is it even worth doing? Do the palms need to be improved? How would you propose to change the palms to improve gripping?

Click here for the link to Zion's story

Dear Nobles,   
We are proud to announce that Shriners Hospitals for Children® was part of a team that made medical history earlier this month. Chief of Staff, Scott Kozin, M.D. and Dan Zlotolow, M.D from Shriners Hospitals for Children – Philadelphia were part of a multidisciplinary medical team that performed the first-ever pediatric bilateral hand transplant by successfully transplanting donor hands and forearms onto eight-year-old Zion Harvey.   
When Zion was referred to Shriners Hospitals for Children, Dr. Kozin and colleagues quickly recognized that Zion was a potential candidate for this transformative procedure, making him the first patient to receive a pediatric hand transplant in the world. In keeping with Shriners Hospitals collaborative approach to care, Dr. Kozin worked together with Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania to assemble a 40+ team of medical experts to perform this complex and demanding 12 hour procedure.    
Zion is a bright and precocious eight-year-old who has told his doctors that he cannot wait to someday throw a football and climb on the monkey bars. Shriners Hospitals looks forward to continuing our support in Zion’s recovery and goals.     
Today’s announcement is a true testament to Shriners Hospitals for Children’s commitment to innovative, world-class pediatric care. Join us in celebrating being a part of history in the making.    
Yours in the faith,

I received a package of this material, and have applied some of it to Chris's hand.  It definitely adds a lot of extra grip over the plain plastic parts.  I have used it to add gripping pads to the proximal and intermediate phalanges.  I think this will be beneficial since the fleshy portion of those fingers provide a lot of grip for a full hand.  The proximal pad is one solid piece and provides a lot of value.  The intermediate portion needs to be split to allow the drive cord room to move, and also needs to be a bit smaller because of how the fingers curl.  Given that, the intermediate is maybe a bit more tenuous and might be more likely to come off.  With both of those pads, though, the grip of the fingers is notably better.

The adhesive on the stuff, at first look, seems pretty strong.  I had to remove one set of pads, and it did not come off easily - which is encouraging.  Only more testing will tell if the adhesive is sufficiently strong for continuous use.  If it turns out that the adhesive fails, 3M does have a version without adhesive (intended for sewn on applications, I guess).  It might be possible to use that with a stronger adhesive.

I cannot think of a way to use this on the fingertips such that I would have confidence in it.  I have tried too many types of fingertip bandages without any success.  I am thinking I will still dip the fingertips in rubber, but then use this TB400 to add more grip like I have it now.

I did get more of this material than I am likely to ever use.  +Peregrine Hawthorn, you mentioned that you wanted to try this stuff.  If you message me your address, I will send you a sheet of it to experiment with.  +Francisco Fernandez, I can probably send you a sheet as well, though I probably need to know the best way to send it to Spain.

The fitting was filmed and will be broadcast on SRF as part of the Cyabathlon. Michel Fornasier request ECF to build the arm because he wants to mentor Lionel into the world of prosthetic use. 
 
This is a new arm that is based on the ECF Ebe Arm with a redesigned RIT hand. Lionel like most young boys wanted it to look like a robot and ECF is excited to maintain its roots of social support of amputee children while expanding into developing world care.

At first I was stressed because the hand didn't function well, but Lionel didn't care. He loved it from the moment he saw it and didn't take it off for hours. Some of his friends came by and they played inside for awhile and than grabbed their bikes for a ride. I was nervous at first, but Lionel is an expert rider and has been using an adaptive arm designed by Marcus Brunner, a local prosthetist.

He mastered the arm for biking in seconds and showed his real skill. It was inspiring for all of us.

I will meet with him again in two weeks. +Jacquin Buchanan and I are working on a new version of the hand.... more to come.

I couldn't ask for a better team to work with than the group on this project. It takes a lot of coordination to design an arm in the USA, print it in Switzerland (by Niklaus Schulz and the team at my3Dworld) and fit it. Additionally, we have a long term plan for follow care for Lionel.

All the work has been worth it, not only have we made a great kid happy but we are building sustainable methods that will help people in the future. This shows the power of the work that ECF is doing.

My name is Adam and I am an Aussie living in Colombia.  I have just got myself a UM2 and plenty of materials and have been practicing etc.  As you may know Colombia is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world and i'm hoping to print some hands to help some of those in need  (as well as non war victims) when i know what I'm doing!    There seems to be alot of modifications/improvemenst etc.  Can someone please point me in the direction of a simple, effective hand and it's files for a first run.  (I have wolverine colors also which would be great to use!).

Cheers,

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LairdPopkin/posts/SJpinEaVa93,"We've been invited to demo e-NABLE at the FIRST Robotics Showcase in Tampa Bay Florida October 11 & 12, and then (likely) at Orlando Regional and the South Florida Regional as well.

If there are e-NABLers in the area, it would be great to make this happen! FIRST is a great organization promoting STEM to kids, and I think there's a natural cross-over of interest between robotics and prosthetics. And I have to say that from being a FIRST FRC judge, they are brilliant, hard-working kids who could really make amazing things happen for e-NABLE. And we'd get to watch tons of passionate kids doing lego/tech/robot challenges!

Terry's email:

""It was great learning about what you do at Maker Faire Orlando - and awesome to hear you've been an FRC judge! Thank you!

We'd love to have e-NABLE at Roboticon Tampa Bay, our annual FIRST Showcase here in Tampa, and I""d like to see if we could get you into the Orlando Regional and the South Florida Regional as well. Our students definitely need to see more great real world applications of what they're learning.

I'm attaching some Roboticon information for you here, and you can learn more about the event at Roboticon.net.

I hope you can join us! Please let me know if you have any questions or would like more information about anything.

With respect to Roboticon, just confirm with me one way or the other by early next week, so I can plan accordingly.

Thank you!
