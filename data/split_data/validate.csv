This hand is 'theme' built as a functional, proof of concept/art project by myself, and should not in anyway reflect the position, values or views of the eNABLE group as a whole.


I want to go into a full disclosure as I feel, sadly, this could easily be misrepresented simply by the pictures alone
I am in NO WAY setting out to weaponize hands, or promote violence in ANY manor. The theme and accessory system is directed to a select group of adult men and women who may appreciate the functionality and color scheme in the hand. The tools are added with full utility and function in mind for daily tasks ONLY, and with the sole hope of making life just slightly easier for adults who may live more of a rugged or outdoor lifestyle.


For the accessory system of this hand, I took commonly shared and used Picatinny rail mounts and added 3 rails to the existing Raptor design. This is a very versatile system and allows almost limitless design of fitted brackets to be printed.
Spoons, cameras, toothbrushes, markers, anything you could design and print a bracket for, can be mounted VERY securely in a couple different ways.
A search on Thingiverse for “picatinny” will show a number of creative and useful designs already available.
http://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=picatinny&sa=


One of the most important features I set out to add on this particular hand, was the ability to securely mount a utility knife. There has been previous questions posted about the difficulty in cooking, and eating with limb differences. Trying to slice a tomato or carrots one handed would of course be a chore, and always needing someone to cut your food could be an inconvenience or even a loss of pride to someone trying to maintain independence and self worth.
On top of that, camping, fishing and many simple daily tasks can be handled much easier with a good utility knife, and a free hand (if available).
The knife I chose is a very small Kabar, with a picatinny mount built right into the handle. It was a perfect fit, is light weight, and mounts rock solid with excellent control. It was also only $13 on ebay, so very affordable. They have other blade designs as well if someone should choose.
*FUN FACT, I used the knife itself to cut all the cable and chord for this build. Putting the usefulness in effect from day one by helping to build the hand itself.


For the remaining mounts, I printed a few designs off thingiverse for a flashlight, and ended up modifying one to fit, then printed it in carbon fiber for strength. Again the mounts fit rock solid and really become part of the hand. That is one beauty of printing, you can scale to very tight tolerances when needed.
I left a 3rd rail open for anything someone could dream of. Camera, watch face, cell phone etc...
I had a great thought about a way to utilize a cell phone easier, as we mainly use Velro in all the straps. I picked up a cheap $3 phone case off amazon and stuck a square of soft Velcro on the back. Now when needed, or for carry, it sticks right onto the palm or forearm very securely. It doesnt come off unless you really pull, so its a perfect use of available Velcro strapping underneath.


All in all I think it turned out wonderful and looks great for what I was going for.


The hand itself is printed in ColorFabb Olive drab green, thanks to Matt Gordon @ PrintedSolid.com, and the light and dark browns were samples donated by our own Jeremy Simon. I think it really came out perfect and I can't thank you guys enough for the colors.

I did paint 3 the small screw nuts at the top of the hand, as the silver was too flashy. I may order some black ones though. The rest is all printed however.

I hope you guys like it.
Now I will go back to working on kids hands again  :)

Check out the way the flexible cords are tied off at the fingertips. I think that's genius!

I've had a lot of difficulties with both the flexible and non-flexible cords when trying to use the method of just tying knots at the end. The knots tend to get pulled through the holes unless they're exactly the right size. I've switched to using ""6/2 seed beads"" for the non-flexible cords. I tie the bead off at the end, then the bead fits into the fingertip but won't fit through the smaller channel, so it holds the cord securely. But I haven't been able to find beads with a large enough inner diameter to fit the flexible cords while still fitting inside the appropriate channel.

With David's approach, there's no chance of the cord being pulled out of it's anchor spot from excessive tension. The second photo shows how the flexible cords are then tied off behind the knuckle block (you can see them behind the non-flexible cords).

I just wanted to call attention to this, as it would be great to see this incorporated into the Cyborg Beast or other designs. [hint, hint... +marc petrykowski, +Maker Block, +Laird Popkin]    ;)

Here's a video of Peregrine introducing his latest build:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtojLN_BHts&feature=youtu.be

Large gauge nylon monofilament is amazing stuff. Because it pushes as well as pulls, you don't need elastics. Also, because it's thick and smooth, it doesn't ""saw"" through the ventral channels of the proximals. For a 3-year-old child, (print scale 90%-110%) I'd consider 1.0-1.2mm 100-150-pound line to be ideal. 2.0mm 400-pound line is about the maximum for an adult, and that would be for a very large man hand of 160-170% print scale. 

I've been able to identify three sources of nylon monofilament, and I have acquired examples of each.

Low-memory deep-sea fishing line is available in  all relevant sizes in 0.2mm increments, up to 2.4mm! I've found an eBay merchant who sells 100 yard coils for 10-17 dollars each, plus five bucks shipping. I just got a bunch (and combined shipping), so I'll probably use a lot of it from now on.

You can also use landscapers' trimmer line, which is available at hardware stores and gas station convenience stores all over the US and Canada. 0.065"" diameter is good for an adult build, and 0.050"" is good for a small child, 100-115% print scale. Trimmer line is what I have mostly used in the hands I've built.

Nylon 3d printing filament is available in 1.75mm at Taulman3d, which would work well in a 120-160% print scale build. I'd suggest Bridge Nylon for lower scales since it is softer and less resistant to bending (lower memory), and nylon 615 for larger scales, since it is more rigid and offers more robust extension of heavier fingertips. I don't have any nylon 645, so I can't comment on its properties yet. 

Peregrine is using the 2.0mm fishing mono here in his 158% scale Talon. I think it's overkill, but he's happy as a clam.

Here is some feedback from my recipient, when he first saw the hand he said  "" Oh WOW!""
This also a good example of an oversized device which was produced using the measurements from the photo using the #tracker program. Maybe use the photocopy, flat-bed scanner and other discussed methods of getting a more one to one scale to gain measurements remotely and enable a bit fit. I was more worried that it was not going to fit when in fact it was too large for his affected hand.

The tracker software stated that the R8 distance was 70.55mm on the non affected hand but was actually 66.35mm and 62.65mm for the affected hand.

I'm also going to put four fingers upon the new printed palm as he was unable to do a ""pinch"" with his index finger. He also  had problems trying  to get fingers to bend upon the first join, (the one nearest the palm) the force required to bend the palm was quite high but that could be due over-tight elastic and it being too large for him.

The experience was positive and he went away with the device to learn the method of operating the hand; He is going to come back next Thursday to try the smaller printed hand, which I will produce before then, together with pouch to hold in the hand  giving him full use of his thumb.

This builds on the direct drive palm idea that I posted yesterday. There is a push plate mounted on the underside of the palm, which is connected to a plate on the surface of the palm via printed pistons. The cylinders can slide up through the palm when the user pushes on it.

When the human palm pushes against the push plate, the bumps rise up to meet the fingers, and the thumb is pushed up to meet the index finger, and the distal phalange is rotated forward via a control cable affixed to the palm.

The thumb in this position could have enormous power. The thumb is added to the plate to create either a cylinder grip or pinch grip. It's a lot more efficient to actuate the thumb directly rather than routing cables with 180 degrees of bending to actuate off of the gauntlet.

This idea isn't even half baked, I really just wanted to show +Skip Meetze  and other interested folks what a push plate in the palm might be used for.

So for now, we're going to rely on our volunteers to use good judgment about which cases to get involved with. For example, if a volunteer has made a Raptor Reloaded and a Cyborg Beast, that volunteer would probably have no trouble making a Phoenix hand, even if he's never made one before and doesn't have that particular badge.

When multiple people offer to help on a case, the person who created the case can review their profiles and see which badges they possess - so they'll still have the option of choosing the person with more documented experience. But this won't be enforced by the application, at least for now. 

This update has now been rolled out.

I just read the article that was posted by the team at Rice that had invented force testing tools for 3d printed hands. 
 
I was quite taken aback to read two quotes from team members of this group stating that, in their judgment, that the 3d printed hands that they had created (using E-Nable’s design !!!) were not sufficiently useful to recipients and that consequently the recipients of these hands, eventually will end up discarding and not using their prosthetic 3d printed hands.
 
If those statements have any truth to them, then in all good conscience, and in the interest of full disclosure, should not E-Nable’s web site include some kind of disclosure statement, stating that there is a degree of controversy as to whether the hands are sufficiently useful to recipients ?
 
Below are the quotes from the two team members:
 
As Amber Wong explains, “Children born without full hands are forced to adapt to the world and figure out how to go about their daily routines. If a prosthetic hand is not absolutely perfect in its function, the child will probably discard it and return to his or her own adaptive ways.”
 
Team member Rachel Sterling says: ““If a kid has to put in five pounds of force to only get one pound of grip, that’s a lot of lost efficiency because of how these hands are designed,” says Rachel Sterling. “Until we reach a force efficiency of 100 percent, the hands aren’t going to be useful.”

Looks to me like a thumbless raptor reloaded would be my best bet?  Likely need to fiddle with the thumb opening to get it right.  Is there a thumbless osprey or Phoenix?  Some testing by my physics students has shown the Phoenix needs about half the force to close as the raptor, so it seems a good design for a kid who might not have lots of strength.

To stretch an STL linearly, you can use a one-line OpenSCAD script, like this:

Install OpenSCAD from http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html . I recommend a development snapshot, as it has vastly better performance than the current ""production"" release.

To stretch an STL in OpenSCAD, run the GUI and put something like this into the editor:

scale([2,0.7,1]) import(""/Users/laird/src/e-NABLE-Assembler/Cyborg_Beast/STL Files/Owens_Hex_Sleeve_7.0.stl"");

Note that you can drop an STL file into OpenSCAD and it will write the import statement with the file's path. This makes imports easy.

The above loads the STL file, scales it by 2x in the X axis, 0.7x in the Y axis, and unchanged (x1) in the Z axis. Use any scaling factor you like.

Hit F6 to compile the design, and then File/Export/Export as STL... to export the scaled STL.

So, for the GUI it's drop the file into OpenSCAD, add the scale function, F6, file/export/STL.

To run this from a command line, create a one-line OpenSCAD file named 'scale.scad' with contents:

scale(scaleFactor) import(name);

And then run it from a command line, like:

openscad -o result.stl -D scaleFactor=[2,0.7,1] -D name = ""/Users/laird/src/e-NABLE-Assembler/Cyborg_Beast/STL Files/Owens_Hex_Sleeve_7.0.stl"" scale.scad

Which assigns the values from the command line to scaleFactor and name, and runs the script, and saves the result as an STL file named result.stl.

So you can now use that simple command line command to scale any STL by X/Y/Z factors as desired. Useful for integrating into automated workflows.

More details are at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Using_OpenSCAD_in_a_command_line_environment .

These designs do NOT have to be based on Hands only. Some of the themes that represent e-nable: Global Village, The Future is in our hands, The community/helping make the world a better place, etc etc - get creative and really think about what e-NABLE is and has come to represent. (we really are about more than hands!)

Things I am looking for:

1. ALL designs MUST BE VECTOR GRAPHICS. Preferably designs that can be created in 1-2 colors maximum to keep costs down on shirts and that will work well on a variety of t-shirt colors.

2. Something specific for children's shirts - maybe a comic book style character with a cool Super hero/Cyborg hand. If you can manage to make something that is gender neutral - that would be fabulous!

3. My favorite quote that really seems to define us: ""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."" Margaret Mead  - create something around that quote that will work for a shirt and I'll love you forever. :)

4. Something for the tech minded/design minded folks. Something creative that they would actually wear as a shirt. :)

5. All tshirts must have our website URL in it somewhere - www.enablingthefuture.org 

If you have a design that you would like to submit for consideration for a t-shirt - please email it to me at enablehands@gmail.com and please put ""Shirt Design"" in the subject line!

We will be adding more and more designs to our store once we get it up and going so we will have a variety of shirts to choose from. :) So please feel free to submit more than one!

Plaster of Paris is a great molding material for casting recipients hands. The trouble is it's pretty fragile stuff. When it comes to molding delicate features like fingers, it's not terribly sturdy. If you're going to be thermolding plastic over the mold, it's not a bad idea to reinforce it.

Fortunately, I happened to have some lovely chopped PVA fiber left over from some experiments making bendable concrete. It's awesome stuff. Using this fiber in conjunction with a plasticizer, I was able to make remarkably impact resistant, bendable concrete boards. It occurred to me that this would be just the stuff for keeping delicate plaster-of-paris fingers in one piece. It stood to reason the stuff would work on plaster-of-paris as well. Here's the stuff I bought:

http://www.concretecountertopsupply.com/index.php?app=ecom&ns=prodshow&ref=PVA5

To find out if it worked, I decided to cast up 5 plaster of paris biscuits in plastic cups with varying amounts of the PVA chopped fiber. For each of the biscuits, I used the following recipe:

2 tbsp Plaster of Paris
1 tbsp Water.

Then I added varying amounts of PVA fiber:

Biscuit 0: No PVA
Bisuite 1: 1 tsp PVA
Biscuit 2: 2 tsp PVA
Biscuit 3: 3 tsp PVA
Biscuit 4: 4 tsp PVA

I mixed up each of the batches, which took about 5 minutes, and then I left them to fully cure for 48hrs. Each of the pucks was about 1/4"" thick or so, which is roughly the thickness of a tiny finger.

Then I cobbled together a testing rig using a half dozen woodworking clamps, 2 small sticks of wood from my scrap pile, a long nail, and a 16oz plastic hammer. I didn't want to spend more than an hour or so on the project so the testing rig isn't exactly pretty. But it worked!

Results:

The PVA made an enormous difference. Biscuit 0, which had no PVA exploded like a clay pigeon on the first impact. Biscuit 1, which had just 1 tsp of PVA cracked, but didn't break. Biscuit 2, with 2 tsp of PVA had a hairline crack only. Biscuit 3 didn't have any damage at all after the first hit with the hammer. In fact, it took about 8 hits with the hammer before a hairline crack formed.

The first video shows biscuit 0 exploding. The second video is of biscuit 1 sustaining little damage after 1 hit. The third video is biscuit 3 being wacked over and over again with no apparent damage.

Depending on how fine the features need to be, I think the right mix is probably between 1 to 2 tsp of PVA to 2tbsp of Plaster of Paris. The PVA fibers do make the plaster harder to mix and pour. One tsp is barely noticeable, but two tsp becomes a bit lumpy. Three tsp is really too much to capture fine detail, and is no longer self leveling.

This may not be terribly helpful to folks who don't have PVA fibers lying around, but I think any chopped fiber, like chopped fiberglass will greatly increase the resiliency of your molded hands/fingers. Given that it takes 48hrs to fully cure plaster of paris, this could be a time saver if it prevents a mold from breaking.

I sent about 1lb of this stuff to +Jeff Erenstone  , who'll be testing it out on an othrotic press. I'll be really curious to see the results!

Since +Nicholas Hall did his post about Oogroo made with the DAP Silicone Adhesive I have been doing my tests with different silicone-adhesives and cornstarch. 

The best one by far is the result of using an adhesive silicone named Sikaflex. I searched online and it looks like this is sold worldwide. I hope so.

Unlike oogroo, their properties are very similar to those of the commercial sugru:
- It is very moldeable.
- You can mould it for 30 minutes. No hurries.
- It cures in 24/48h.
- It sticks like hell to almost anything.
- Stays like that forever*.

*: If you do oogroo with enough cornstarch to make it moldeable (like sugru) it will dry and get weak in 1 month. This does not happen with Sikagru. The cups from the photo have 2 months and we use them everyday. The material properties didn't change at all after the first day.

I have done tests on several materials and it sticks until the point that if you want to take it out it breaks before. So it's pretty adhesive.

I have done tests to a flat surface of ABS as well (sorry, no photos) and it sticks pretty well. Much much better than regular Oogroo. But here, with enough strength, you can take it out without breaking it. Anyway I think it's good enough (probably just like commercial sugru).

Here in Europe, sikaflex costs 5€ per bottle. That's twice the price of regular silicone, but still pretty affordable.

+Nicholas Hall if you find the time I would love you to put this on the kind of stress tests you were doing to your other oogroo innovations, to see what are the real improvements in adhesiveness.

I have done tests with 1:1 ratio (in weight!). Sikaflex is pretty sticky, so you need a lot of cornstarch (1:1 in weight is a lot more of cornstarch than sikaflex in volume :) )

If you reduce the amount of cornstarch, you will end up having to wait a lot to mould it (1-2 hours!) or never been able to.
If you increase the amount of cornstarch you won't be able to mix it. Actually, with the 1:1 you have to finish the mix with your hands until it becomes like plasticine.

Your work with utilizing 3D printing to produce low cost solutions in a high tech manner is truly inspiring.  
I live in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  My daughter is interested in pursuing a career in biomedical engineering.  She is in the 10th grade and is enrolled in an IB (International Baccalaureate) program.  She is currently working on an independent study presentation about the history and future of prosthetics.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/110257220895777457001/posts/PMKFczDKwyY,"So... I have a thought, and I would really like some input.  I think current designs are closing in a sub-optimal way - at least in regards to grasping objects - and I consider that the primary purpose of these devices.

When a user closes the hand there are three possibilities:
1) the distal part curls in first, followed by the mostly or completely curled finger curling at the metacarpal-phalangeal joint into the palm
2) both joints curl at the same time
3) the finger stays straight and folds in towards the palm, followed by the distal section curling

From my observations, 1 happens the vast majority of the time - 2 happens some of the time - 3 happens pretty much never.

The problem is, both 1 and 2 cause problems for grasping an object.  The fingertip gets pulled in and interferes with getting the object into the palm.  I would think 3 is the ideal.  The fingers should fold at the metacarpal-phalangeal joint until the pads of the proximal phalanges contact the object.  Only then should the intermediate and distal curl in to tighten the contact.

Am I missing something?

I think it is possible to tweak the fingers to make them act as I describe - to make 3 the most common behavior.  I want to be sure, though, that I have not overlooked something in my analysis.  I do get that this would make it harder to pick things up by pinching against the tips of the fingers.  I think that could be accommodated if it is just an occasional need more than the standard.

Greetings. I have been interested in this project over a year now and I will soon be getting my own printer to start creating these devices. I have spent hours in this group reading and getting ideas on how about getting things started and who to get involved in this. 

I am living in the Czech Republic (In Prague to be exact) and I am trying to focus on getting parts to create these hands locally rather than ordering out of country. I have been reading up about the coverings used on the tips. More so the Lee Tippi Micro Gel Fingertips. I can not find them locally around and to order from Amazon would cause added cost and manufacturing time, waiting for them to arrive. 

I have seen alternate posts here about using a heavy duty rubberized work glove that I will be looking into but I also remember seeing the following video and also some alternative finger designs. So  in the following video a person was making a replacement watch strap holder and soaked the PLA printer material in acetone and it made it a bit flexible and ""rubberized"".

I also noticed a couple of variant finger designs for the hands that have little nubs on the fingertips instead of the usual covers. I was wondering if anyone has tried one of the following: 

Take one of the fingers and spit it horizontally from midway to the bottom and soak it in the Acetone and see if it becomes more pliable, and then attach it back to the finger. Or take one of the alternate designs with the nubs and and redesign it so the nubs prints out where there are small indents where the numbs used to be, and the actual nubs print out separately, then soak the numbs in the acetone and afterwards attach them back to the fingertips. 

I am curious to see if the parts soaked in the Acetone would help improve the grip so it might be able to be used as an alternative than the gel tips for those places where it is difficult to find them. I am waiting to get my Printer in the upcoming weeks and I will be trying this to see how it works out, but I am curious if anyone else has tried this, and also wondering if there would be an issue using this process when creating a hand for a child and the use of chemicals.

Peregrine Hawthorn's brilliant new push/pull tendon solution:

I was looking at +Peregrine Hawthorn new video yesterday of his tricked out hand picking up an e-nable water bottle, and I saw him mention in the comments that he was using a very unique solution.

I'll leave it up to him to tell you how he did, mostly because it's brilliant and it's his idea, and partly because I don't totally understand his setup :)

In short, the hand can work with no elastics in the fingers! It only has 1 cable, which is capable of both pushing and pulling! This is pretty incredible.

The black elastics that we use waste an enormous amount of gripping energy. For small children with weak wrists, it's possible that the elastics consume more than 50% of the available gripping strength!

+Adam Arabian and team's solution with dental elastics was a huge leap forward, and a brilliant idea; but no elastics whatsoever is pretty tough to beat!

Here are some photos and a short video of my crude attempts to replicate what +Peregrine Hawthorn did. It works surprisingly well.

+Peregrine Hawthorn I can't wait to see how the hand is set up. If you could post some pics and video of the new configuration it would awesome. I'm guessing you had a more elegant solution than my ""masking tape"" approach :)

Amazing work!

I am living in the Netherlands and I am going to make my first hand for a 5 year old boy  and I could use some advice on which type of hand would be most suitable for him.

My feeling is that this is not enough to activate a wrist activated device. Can anyone advise me on this?

My best guess is that the unlimbited arm would be the better way to go, but than I don't know if the part that is sticking out (on the position where normally the thumb is) will need adjustments on the arm? Or can this be solved by positioning the velcro on an other place?

Over the past few weeks it has come to my attention that there is spreading confusion regarding the ECF chapter process - who is maintaining them, and how an entity becomes an officially recognized chapter. Please be aware of the following key points, that should address these issues:

- In order to become an officially recognized ECF chapter you MUST be directly tied to an educational institution such as a college, university, or school
- Any entity that is not directly tied to an educational institution will fall under a different category of relationship with the ECF (this formal process is still currently being developed)
- There is an application process that can be found at the ECF Chapters Page on the ECF website, PLEASE NOTE: The application is subject to review by the ECF Chapter Coordinator - Joe Fairley, and ECF CEO - Grace Mastalli
- Currently, we have only been working with US-based educational institutions, but we are open to applications coming from international educational institutions
- Monthly chapter meetings for approved educational institutions will become available at the end of July
- The approval of our first officially recognized chapters will be made known on July 8th, 2016

The benefits of becoming an officially recognized ECF chapter are as follows:

- Establish a nationally recognized entity directly tied to the Enable Community Foundation
- Benefit from the structure and coordination of how a chapter operates in order to better reach your recipients
- Establish good standing with your institution and provide them with validity for any needed support (financial, space, tools/materials, advisement)
- Benefit from a monthly meeting with other chapters to ask questions, provide feedback and innovative design ideas, receive troubleshooting support
- Allow recipients to seek you out in a more organized and designated workflow, be able to reach more people in an influential way

Please let me know what further questions you all have and make sure to be on the lookout for a couple posts coming from me soon regarding application approvals and the new monthly meetings with approved chapters.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My name is Brian Kaminski and I'm the founder and owner of Advancer Technologies. I recently became aware that the e-NABLE community uses a lot of our muscle sensors in their amazing projects. I have a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering (biomechanics) and a M.S. in Mechanical Engineering and at one time aspired to be a prosthestician.

I originally started my company after I designed and built an EMG sensor for a robotic therapy glove/orthosis that was a continuation of my senior design work. I had become extremely frustrated during my senior design project that there were't any off the shelf EMG sensors for students and hobbyist to use in their projects so I thought I could help others out and started selling my sensor. Surprisingly, what I had initially thought as a way to generate some small amount of pocket cash to try to offset the costs my own hobby/projects has become a growing business and has allowed me to continue improving the sensor design, drive the cost down, and make fun and exciting tutorials to help cultivate and motivate the next great minds into the field. 

Anyways, I just wanted to let the community know that your work is very close to my heart and I would like to get more involved in any way I can.

Please feel free to email me if you would like to use our sensors in your projects; I am more than happy to make our sensor available to the e-NABLE community for at-cost pricing.

Also, don't hesitate to email or contact me if you need my expertise or advice on how to add muscle sensors to your project.

Thanks so much for all your great work so far and I'm excited to see what the future brings.

Cheers,
Brian

So I had mentioned quite some time ago that I was working a multi-material 3D printed anthropomorphic device, that uses dual extrusion printing for enhanced functionality. It's been a while but I have finially finished the design and validation for graduation project (Masters in Industrial Design at TU Delft, Netherlands)

So introducing here, Ex-Machina, prosthetic device that is anthropomorphic in function (as compared to the K-1 which is anthropomorphic in form and shape) using the principles of biomechanics to provide a truly 'opposable' thumb.

The whole finger (including knuckle - refer the orange finger picture in the photos below) is printed as one piece using a dual extrusion Ultimaker printer (upcoming printer) with the flex (filaflex from Recreus) printed together with the PLA. For the hand prototype here, the pieces were printed with Ultimaker 2+ separately and then glued together, but the design is proven to be printable with any dual extrusion printer (as long as you get the print profiles right!).

Key design element is that the thumb joint is placed in the device relative to other fingers, just like the human hand. This also means there is less space for the user's wrist stump, so the Palm section has to be slightly larger. Using the whippletree mechanism and gauntlet of the Pheonix as of now (160% size used here)

Looking forward to feedback from the R&D people and any users in this community.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/115790229936940393119/posts/2fWLYfipMm5,"I was very intrigued by +Nicholas Hall's idea of dipping the plastic in boiling water to bond the layers together better. I set up my own experiment to see if I could get any interesting results.

I started by printing some ABS ""sticks."" They're long boxes made about the same width and thickness of the bottom rail of a Raptor gauntlet at 100%. I dipped the sticks in boiling water for varying amounts of time. Then I placed them between two chairs with a bucket hanging from them. I slowly filled the bucket with water. When the sticks broke, I recorded how much water was used. Since 1 ml = 1 gram, This was an easy way to roughly measure the weight needed to break a stick. My measurements weren't terribly exact, but they made a decent approximation for a first test.

I found that they all broke at about the same weight. There seemed to be a little progress at one point, but one of the chairs holding the sticks also moved a little. This had changed the leverage on the stick. I tried to correct it, and the next stick broke at the same weight. Either way, the variance was too small to be significant.

Stick dimensions:
4.5x100x6mm

Print settings:
35% infill
.20mm
2 shells

Process:
The ends of the stick are placed on two separate surfaces, spanning them like a bridge. A bucket is hung on the middle of the stick. Water is added to the bucket until the stick breaks.

Note:
There was one issue in boiling the sticks. At 35% infill, ABS floats. I had to use a kitchen utensil and a paperclip to lightly hold them under the water.

Breaking Weights:
ABS normal - 5kg
ABS 5 sec in boiling water - 5kg
ABS 10 sec in boiling water - 5kg
ABS 20 sec in boiling water - 5.35kg
ABS 30 sec in boiling water - 5.3kg
ABS 20 sec in boiling water - 5kg

I tried this in ABS because that's what my printer is currently loaded with. I'm going to switch to PLA in a few days after some other projects and try again. It may be that water just doesn't boil hot enough to do much for ABS. Perhaps I should try boiling them in oil.

Any thoughts on my process or suggestions for changes in the PLA tests?

This idea was first proposed by +Jason Bryant and I think it's brilliant! I'm highlighting it here because I think it connects a lot of logistical dots from a supply chain management perspective with broad implications from everything to +Enable Matcher new short palm solution, to +Jon Schull shoe store model.

One of the things that I've been thinking a lot about is standard sizing in +Jon Schull Shoe Store model. If we were able to statistical analysis of the exact palm sizes of our current 500 users based on the tracker software data, we could determine what 5 standard sizes would fit 50% of our future recipients.

+Jorge Zuniga has already done preliminary sizing regression analysis with good results, so it makes me think that this could be a workable approach.

https://plus.google.com/112924685807628863357/posts/cwuJhTvZYtA

If we were able to do standard sizing, it opens up a whole lot of options. For one, we could create inventory of parts that have been assessed for quality. But more interestingly, we could start to think about injection molding at some point in the future when designs mature.

An injection mold for a single hand size could be purchased for less than $10k, and 2000 hands created at a cost of $5-$10 per hand. All of the parts would be of dramatically better quality right out of the box, and at a cost that is less than the current cost per hand. If we're really successful in creating a hand with demand of 10,000 units per year globally, injection molding might be the only plausible option to satisfy this demand.

+Bob Roth and I were talking about the prospect of injection molding in the distant future. And +Laird Popkin and other's have discussed small batch molding in the more near term.

One thing that would make this standard sizing possible is to segregate the palm into 2 pieces. The first piece of the palm would be the outer shell, such as currently exists. The second piece of the palm would be the inner shell, which actually customizes the fit to the recipients palm.

You'd use a variation on the brilliant work that +Skip Meetze has done with his printed palm here:

https://plus.google.com/105069495767890395465/posts/7oHm6LBj5Rv

Basically, the outer shell might be standardized at 40mm wide by 50mm long for kids 7-9. Then you'd print the inner shell to fit the width correctly, and the length correctly. The inner shell could attach to the outer shell via snap pins or screws. Thus you could actually adjust the fit just by changing the inner shell. This would allow for either the stocking of outer shell inventory by either 3d printing or injection molding, but still allow for a custom fit for the recipient.

I saw this idea looking at +Carl flood brilliant modular gauntlet design, which can be found here:

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+SkipMeetze/posts/8xyKYyG75gk,"Jason Bryant recently posted an interesting tensioner design where a Steve Wood 3-element whippletree is attached to tensioner pins with a screws and the tendons are tied to the pins in the standard way.  Then the assembly is covered in a tidy arrangement.  

This got me thinking about adapting the singletree type of whippletree https://www.youmagine.com/designs/adaptive-grip-mechanism-for-prosthetic-hand which is simpler to assemble and seems to have some extra adaptive benefits from the tendons going around pegs that act as pulleys.  

If this tensioner works as I hope it will, it could deal with my concern that some 3-jointed digits result in the wrist being hyper-flexed to fully flex the fingers.  With this device,  the user can increase the tension to flex the fingers at anytime by pulling on the little handle and decrease the tension to extend the fingers by pushing on the handle.  

The user can maintain a comfortable wrist position while gripping a bicycle handlebar for instance.  

I may not get to test the design for a couple of weeks, so I would appreciate it if someone would print it out and give me some feedback.  Maybe we can do a video hangout if you run into problems or if you have something good to show.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/+PeregrineHawthorn/posts/HbXfKqazJjE,"The Raptor: a review

So I've been using the Raptor for a few days now, and I'm gonna go out and say that it's pretty good. 

My first impressions were A: it's really cool looking, and B: is pretty comfortable. 

The gauntlet:
Unlike the Cyborg Beast, the interior of the Raptor is modeled after an arm. The gauntlet makes a nice, low, wide arch that doesn't pinch my arm, but still conforms to it. However, in contrast to the Talon, the rigid structure of the gauntlet and tensioner makes for very responsive fingers. My sole complaint is that it feels to short. I feel like I lose some leverage from the single strap so close to my wrist. 

I would extend it back a few inches, and, as a matter of personal preference, use a combination of leather and Velcro straps like the Talon, instead of the single Velcro strap.

The unipalm:
The palm itself is very nice. It's sturdy, and the holes are plenty wide for the cables. The cable guide easily goes far enough back that there's no chance of the corner digging into my wrist, a problem we struggled with with the Talon in the past. However, I can't help but feel that the whole palm is to long, but that extra room would be useful for someone with more part the wrist than I have. After adjusting the Velcro, I have about an inch and a half between my paw and the inside of the knuckles. My only other issue with the unipalm is, again, more with the Velcro. The ability to adjust to multiple residual hand sizes is nice, but the attachment to only a few points in the upper palm make for a lot of pushing together and pulling apart of the Velcro, and it 'stretches' away from the palm at anything challenging my grip.

The fingers: 
Again, the fingers are plenty sturdy, and they have a comfortable blocky bulk to them (that you could easily fit an entire Swiss army knife in). The action is very smooth, and the gel grips go the fingertips snuggly as well, and appear to confirm to their shape.

That being said, I have two complaints about the fingers. The first one, somewhat related to how smooth the action is, is how LOUD the fingers are. Every movement is accompanied by the loose clicking and clacking of the finger parts rattling against each other. This may not be an issue in smaller models, but at 158%, it's highly pronounced. The next issue is that the cables haven't got much travel in them, making for a grip without much torque. The strength is slightly more comparable to the Cyborg Beast than the Talon.

Overall:
This is a pretty good model, and with a little more tweaking, it could easily be our base hand we model everything off of. The design is open, comfortable, and lightweight. I'm looking forward to seeing where this design goes.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Recently came across the openbionics and then e-nable projects and am ridiculously excited to get involved! 

Getting ahead of myself though :) I'm a senior ops engineer by trade based in Cape Town, South Africa. Have been building 3D printers/drones/motorcycles/electronics  for several years as well as contributing to various open source project in fpv drones, flight controllers, home automation etc. 

As of April my wife, son and I will be relocating to Germany for various reasons but from a career perspective I'm moving to primarily be able to contribute towards companies that will make the reality out son grows up in a better place.

Myself as well as a network of like minded engineers/friends are wildly enthralled by the prospect of being able to apply the hobby and professional skills we have learned in order to directly contribute to making the lives and world others live in a better place

I just tested my 3rd test plate and I was blown away by how well the oogoo was stuck to the plate. It turns out that allowing the oogoo to fully cure over the course of 24hrs makes a huge difference with regards to the strength of the mechanical bond. I think the bond strength is getting very close to 50psi.

When I tried prying it up from 1 corner to pry the oogoo off the plate, I actually wound up tearing the 1/4""thick oogoo skin. That takes a lot of force. The original test plate that I pulled up was disappointing, but it had only been curing for 2hrs or so. Giving the oogoo enough time to fully cure made a big difference.

I'm guessing that the tear strength to pull the oogoo skin off of the 1""x1"" plate is somewhere around 50psi. I'm not strong enough to pull it off. 50 psi is pretty darn good as a starting point!

I think that it's possible to double the strength of the mechanical bond  by changing the mesh. Fortunately, Laird anticipated that I'd ask for the wrong thing the first time around. So instead of just sending me a flat STL of the mesh, he actually wrote an OpenSCAD program that generates any custom mesh you want. The man is a genius.

For starters, you can change the dimensions of the mesh plate to any length, or width you want. You can also customize the diameter of the tubes, the spacing of the tubes, and the number of layers. It's pretty incredible. I had never used OpenSCAD before in my life, and I was a little intimidated to try it since I'm such a 3d noob. It took just 60 seconds to download, and Laird's program was so intuitive that I was able to generate exactly the mesh that I wanted in 5 minutes. If you're interested at all in experimenting with an oogoo bonding mesh, I strongly encourage you to try it out.

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:518257

The next mesh I'm going to try will have wider spacing between rows so that the oogoo ""tubes"" are much wider relative to the plastic bars. This should greatly improve it's ability to resist being torn up from the corners. I'm also going to change my oogoo mix to include more cornstarch. This will increase the durometer, and reduce it's elasticity. It appears that the bond failure occurs when the small diameter oogoo tubes stretch past their tear point elongation of about 350%. I think lowering the oogoo's elasticity will make a difference.

My hope is to get the bond up somewhere around 100psi. That should be good enough for government work :)

Here are the links to my next 2 test plate meshes on thingiverse if anyone wants to try printing them out and testing the bonding with Oogoo. I expect the thicker tube version to have a bond somewhere around 100psi or more.  +Adam Arabian +Skip Meetze 

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:525162/#files

The fine mesh pictured is only about 2mm thick, which is pretty low profile. It should be possible to print this mesh on any surface area where oogoo, sugru, or any other soft RTV elastomer is wanted. It could be applied to fingertips, the proximal phalanges, the palms for gripping, or elsewhere on the hand for padding or impact resistance.

As such they have a print quality challenge similar to what we have, in that when we match up a fabricator we'd like to know that they can produce quality hands. 3DHubs has a process for verifying a new printer's print quality, by sending a specific test print and having the person perform the print and submit a photograph for review, which they require before listing people as being available for print jobs. And they have training material to help improve people's print quality.

There's been some discussion of a 'test hand', which is certainly a good way to start. Perhaps we could take that idea and make it formal, and before matching people, have people print and assemble a test hand, and submit a photograph for quality assessment? That's cheaper and easier for all involved than sending the actual hands. Of course, we'd need a team to review the photos for quality assessment, and to provide feedback to fabricators.

It also strikes me that if we run the process ""in public"" (e.g. in forum posts) then we could generate tons of good examples of various print quality, with associated discussions of techniques for improving prints, which would be valuable for fabricators, particularly ones new to 3d printing.

Of course, there's a tradeoff between a formal process like this and number of fabricators, so we might end up with fewer fabricators on the map, but they'd more more validated.

The biggest limitation of existing wrist powered e-nable hands is grip strength. I've heard anecdotally that many children have difficulty picking up a full can of soda. This is a problem not only because soda is delicious part of childhood, but also because inadequate grip strength means the utility of the device is limited. We don't like talking about it, but it's true.

We can tweak existing designs to reduce friction, or elastic resistance (like +Peter Binkley  and +Peregrine Hawthorn have done brilliantly via push-pull bowden cables), but at best we can make the useful grip strength 20%-30% stronger through these approaches. To materially increase the gripping force by 100% or more, there are 2 viable avenues: adding power to the device or adding mechanical advantage.

Powered Devices:

This is a area where many people are doing exciting work right now. Powered devices have tremendous potential, but there many tradeoffs. Introducing electronics into the hands adds significant cost, fabrication complexity, weight, and ongoing maintenance support, while reducing the durability and reliability of the device. Given the tradeoffs inherent in powering devices, the prospect of mechanically advantaged actuation is worth exploring.


Mechanically Advantaged Actuation:

Mechanically advantaged actuation offers the ability to increase the grip force by 100% to 500%, limited only by the strength of the plastic joints and fingers, not the child's wrist strength. It also allows the user to determine the optimal wrist position in which to pick an object up; no more 90 degree wrist contortions to pick up a pencil.

The principle is dead simple; rather than closing the hand all of the way with a single flex of the wrist, a single flex of the wrist only closes the hand half-way, but does so with 100% more gripping force. A ratchet mechanism saves the progress. Using such a device, a child would be able to pick up large objects like a can of soda with only a single wrist flex; or small objects like a marble with two flexes of the wrist. A Obviously, the mechanical advantage can be whatever the designer wants it to be; for a very small child with a very weak wrist, 3 flexes for full closure might be the right ratio.

As mentioned above, there is another significant advantage to this design that should not be overlooked; the user is able to decide what his wrist position will be when picking up an object. With current designs, to pick up a small object like a marble, a child must contort their wrist into a 90 degree bend. Try to pick up a pencil from your desk with your wrist bent to 90 degrees while seated; see how hard that is? Not only is it quite difficult to do, it's also extremely difficult to maintain this position for any length of time. With a 2:1 or 3:1 ratchet mechanism, the user can decide what position they want their wrist to be in when they pick up an object; this may add even more utility to a device than the extra grip strength does.

From where I sit, if someone figures out how to integrate mechanical advantage into a hand it will easily be the most important innovation of 2016. If that sounds like hyperbole, consider that it would give e-nable hands >100% better gripping power than the leading commercially available wrist powered product, the M-Fingers from Partial Hand Solutions.

I could prattle on about the promise and potential of mechanically advantaged actuation, but you hopefully your imagination is already starting to consider what e-nable hands would be capable of with 100% higher grip strength. It's way beyond my abilities to design such a device, so I raise it as a design challenge to those of you out there with sharper modeling skills and keener minds. To my knowledge, the original proposed design for adding mechanical advantage, was posted by +Erik de Bruijn  (yes the Ultimaker co-founder!) in Sept of 2014. It was just a quick sketch, but it's a very interesting start.

Just over two weeks ago my daughter was admitted to the hospital ICU. She got a rare strain of the cold that coincided with an asthma attack. It resulted in her left arm being paralyzed, a general weakening of her core muscles, and spinal nerve damage due to a viral infection and the pressure it caused. It's a very rare condition called 'Acute flaccid myelitis' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_flaccid_myelitis)

Only 20% of children who have gotten this have had a full recovery. Most have had very little if any. Which is why we have been looking for alternative treatments to complement the physical therapy and rehabilitation therapy we are starting to do. My daughter and I decided that it would be really cool if we would build a robotic prosthetic arm to help her arm move. Lorelei is super excited with this and over the past few days we have started to look into it. We are also researching various other possible treatments, and we have received a lot of great advice so far and would welcome any other info that could help us. Lorelei is actively taking part in her own treatment, helping me research and building her own arm, she has been an inspiration to us all!

And this was when we found this community who are doing something similar.

I'm IV. year student of orthotics/prosthetics, from Latvia, Riga Stradiņš university.

for most inspiration i've analysed ''raptor reloaded'', ''flexy-hand 2'' and ''exii hackberry''.

List of things I've been focusing on to improve model compared to others:
1)thumb opposition - ''cyborg beast'' thumb is not functional in grip, so i sacrificed the size of palm(made it bigger) to make thumb in opposition;
2)phalanges - more joints between phalanges make more attrition, so i made fingers with only 2 phalanges, distal interphalangeal joint movement doesn't affect power of grip that much as efficiency of patient's strength to control the hand;
3)cable end/nail - one of the most common 'mistakes' for other models is that cable end hole is located in fingertip are - hiding hole under nail 'fixes' the problem of grasping as well it is more aesthetic because it gives opportunity to customize nails as patient wants, without re-modeling fingers;
4)finger joint type - elastic band system(''raptor hand'') takes a lot of space in fingers, which could be replaced with sensors, etc.
ninjaflex joints work fine, but the composing is quite a mess to fit the thick end into palm and didn't made a trust in me, so i choosed the torsion springs for finger extension. It is more costly than other two methods(20(for two hands) torsion springs costs 60 EUR, but it should work faster, easier composing of fingers.
5)palm surface - ABS/PLA plastic is hard and slips over most of the materials, so the grip is slippery as well.  
Palm surface attrition affect power grip of hand, so i cut special socket for power grip to easily grasp handlebars, broom etc.(see photo with printed green palm above thermoformed plastic cover)



I've been using following software/hardware:
Scan - Structure sensor with Skanect software combined with iPhone5 
Scan smoothing, fixing - Autodesk meshmixer
CAD - Autodesk fusion 360
Slicer - Craftware( best interface and support generating options i have discovered by far)
3d printer - Mass Portal Pharaoh ED (made in Latvia)
3d printer settings:
ABS - 240-250/110-115 C
0.4 nozzle; 0.1 layer height;

I tested it out in Customizer, and it seems to work well.  You can set the number of tuner rods, set the size to M2, M2.5, M3 (or the exceedingly unlikely M4 or M5), can adjust the length of the rods, can adjust the size of the hole for the string, and can set the clearance for the tuners.  You can select if you want to generate just the tuners, or just the block, or both - but you have to use 0 to generate and 1 to skip.  (The original OpenSCAD used true/false, but that wasn't working so well in Customizer.)  You should also be able to set the hole sizes to match custom ones (like non-metric sizes) if you use the OpenSCAD file directly.

Just like Ivan's version, this one does not include a mount.  It creates only the block.  You would then either create the stl and mash it up with the mount you want, or you can incorporate the OpenSCAD script into the mount.

CALLING ALL FABRICATORS! IF YOU HAVE A 3D PRINTER, WE NEED YOUR HELP!

We need everyone's help to print Raptor Hand parts for the Johns Hopkins event! We only have a couple of weeks, and we need to print a LOT of hands, so we need everyone's help with this!

Here is a spreadsheet outlining all of the sizes and quantities needed. Just place your name in the column under the size you're printing, and set the color of the cell according to the color you printed. The totals at the top will update automatically. Just for fun, I added a ""Challenge"" tab showing who's making the most hands.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hSn2dm24C5Kgopu3jCbb8IEbVi9VWK3XakIhQQttvYM/edit?usp=sharing

All parts should be printed in PLA. Any colors are fine.

STL files can be found here: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7IZ4iPA1DJZWnVHN2RtdnB5WlU&usp=sharing

All individual STL files are scaled at default (100% scale) size. Scale each part up to arrive at the desired scale (i.e. to print at 125% scale all parts need to be scaled by 1.25).

The files with names that start with ""All parts..."" include all parts needed for a single hand, and are already scaled to the size indicated in the file name. If you want to print all parts at once (and your build plate is at least 6x9""), there's no need to change anything - just slice and print.

This was kind of what I was picturing. Incorporating a graduated block and tackle into the back plate of the hand. 

Problems I see with this (aside from my near-total lack of math and engineering):
1. Force is no longer running in nice straight lines and could cause extra lateral stresses on the gauntlet.
2. More moving fiddly bits.
3. How much 'rope' we have available to actually allow the cam to do its work.

Benefits:
1. Retains the built-in adaptive grip provided by the palm side elastics.
2. Perhaps fewer tiny knots to manage. (Though greater impact from cable failure.)


Sort of related: I was wondering if those nice wide elastics could be incorporated into being part of the gripping surface.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I drew the yellow string in by hand. The idea is the primary whippletree is a string through a curved slot and tied to the top of each of the tension bars. The tension bars slide freely in the dovetailed channels. The bottom of the tension bars have curved slots just like the original whippletree. The thumb string goes through a slot and is tied off.

I don't have any screws. I don't think they are needed. But this is my question to the community. Are the screws really needed? I realize no screws requires tying knots at just the right spot. But didn't think that was a real problem.

I could easily redesign with screws. The thumb can be another tensioner in a channel with a screw adjustment at the top. Likewise another channel could be added between the current two with a screw adjustment at the top. I only want to add the screws if they are really needed.

I am still making adjustments. In my first print the tolerances were too tight. The whole thing needs to be slightly larger. Getting the top string in is a little difficult. I am going to try and open that up a little. ",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I've been messing around a lot with a design I'm making from scratch, but decided, at least for the immediate future ,to construct a modified version of David Orgeman's second degree hand combined with the partial finger replacement  by Ivan Owen. The original models which I derived  can be found on Thingiverse if anyone is curious.
  You can see in the background of the picture I took of some parts how much support was used. Since was the biggest supported print I've ever done I was really surprised how well Slic3r handled it.  This did make me think, however, that in the distant future I'd like to redesign some of these more universal gauntlet parts to instead be made of smaller strips of plastic connected to some underlying cloth and padding.  The result would be a flexible wrist attachment which could be printed on small printers and without much support, if any at all.  I think a lot of people could really benefit from this given the number of people who have little printers like the printrbot Simple.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Here is an example of the V2.0 that I modified to print vertically.   This was modified in NX9 from a STEP file, then sent to MakerBot Desktop.  It was printed with 2 shells, 35% fill, 0.20mm layer height and roughly 100mm/sec speed, 220F with PLA.   I made the supports in NX, so I only used a raft to attach to the printer bed, no tape or other goop, direct to the acrylic bed on one of my MakerBot Replicator 2s.   The first example is just at 100% showing the two orientations.  It is clear that the vertically printed version is much cleaner, and requires very little post bench work.  The second example is a 130% scale, vertically only, same settings.  I had a print error at the last couple of percent, so ignore the error at the top, where the wrist hinge goes.  I seem to get these errors from time to time where a ""glitch in the SD card has been found"" or something like that.  Probalby a MakerBot flaw.    Let me know if you want me to post a STEP or STL file to test out, or just do your own version.  (Note I removed the countersunk holes for the padding, I found them to be visually offensive, so gone they are.)

I've been working on a modular design to replace the Phoenix hand in the Unlimbited Arm design. 

This design is for the base. Attachments fit into one of the 5 octagonal holes and are held in place by magnets.The base is attached to the thermoformed gauntlet by the same wrist pins from the Phoenix hand. 

I'd love some feedback, and I have a couple of questions for you all:

What do you think of the aesthetics? Should they be more organic or geometric?

Is there a way to redesign the pins to make it easier to  attach and remove the base?

Thanks!!

I am wondering if we can collect some information about how well hands hold up in real life and what the long term perception of users might be.  

I have two persisting questions:
1.  Do users continue to use their hands after the ""shine"" has worn off and if not why, and
2.  Do they break and if so how and how do they get them fixed?

This is an important feedback loop to make sure we are providing the best hands we can.  Do we have relevant hashtags?  Would it be possible to encourage closing contact after some duration of use - perhaps a month or two?

I feel like until we get a solid number of hands out and feedback back from them that they ARE being used and AREN'T breaking we are just guessing on our design.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

A few weeks ago I had CNN-HLN on in the background as I was cleaning my home office and was inspired by a story about someone from E-Nable. The story was about 3d printing making prosthetics more affordable but the 'hook' on this particular story was that the person made it look like Iron Man's hand. I don't mind admitting I got a little choked up.  I started looking into the realities and misconceptions about 3d printing and the more I saw, the more I was encouraged. Software wasn't thousands of dollars, most of it is free now. Printers weren't $5k they could be found under a thousand. Also, as steep as the learning curve is, there is a very cooperative community. 

I was at the forefront of computing in the '70's, desktop publishing and graphic arts in the '80's, webpage design and publishing in the '90's and then I went into public speaking and event production. Besides my small ebay store and the occasional convention job I've mostly been a 'stay at home dad' with two children for the last 10 years. I did weeks of research and even stumbled upon a local meeting with a Shapeways representative at a new ""Maker Space"". I have a relative who has agreed to consult with me (he has been doing 3d design for 13 yrs and 3d 
printing for a while). I also have a good friend who is eager to assist me who is an engineer supervising quality control over industrial 3d prototyping 
and development.

I've built a team, I've joined the groups, I've ordered a FlashForge Dreamer and a variety of about a dozen plus types of filament. My family and I have been discussing what I should try to make as my official first print. Last night we decided on a raptor hand in a variety of colors and materials that will be assembled by my 9 year old son and 7 year old daughter. I plan to videotape the process and post it to my websites and youtube, etc.
I am eager though to start working with someone locally that has a real need for a prosthetic. We live 10 miles from Disney World, does anyone know anyone nearby that I could help?
Thanks,
Keith Johnson
